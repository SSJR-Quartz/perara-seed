1,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroZora_000,"この地方を巡って
英傑ミファーの逸話を聞いているうちに…
師匠の未完の詩とは別に
私も彼女を表現してみたくなりました
そこでミファーが操ったという
この神獣 ヴァ・ルッタの元で…","Ah! Wandering around here and listening
to anecdotes aboutChampion Mipha
has truly invigorated me.
In fact, it has inspired me to honor
her in my own way, separate from
my teacher'sunfinished song.
That is why I felt inclined to roost here,
near theDivine Beast Vah Ruta,
whichMipha herself mastered."
2,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroZora_001,"こんな詩を作ってみました
ありし日の英傑ミファーの姿を描く詩…","I've written a song...to try and capture
the essence ofChampion Mipha..."
3,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroZora_100,"♪これは""ルッタを繰りし者が
未だ英傑と""呼ばれる前の物語
その名はミファー… ゾーラの王女
里訪れし姫と""滝の音間近に…","♪Recall the ChampionofRuta's wrath,
before she walkedher chosen path.♪

♪Mipha's kindnesswas known to all,
which is why the princesscame to call.♪"
4,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroZora_500,"…お優しい姫と語り継がれていますが
毅然たる一面も お持ちだったようですよ","Hmm... Though she was known for her
kindness, it seems the Zora princess
could be quite strict when necessary."
5,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroZora_501,"いかがでしたか？
英傑ミファーの詩
彼女の決意を詩に出来たことで
師匠に一歩近づけたような気がします","So? What do you think of
Champion Mipha's Song?

By writing a song that captures the
determination of Champion Mipha, I feel
closer than ever to my dear teacher."
