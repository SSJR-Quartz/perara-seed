1,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroGerudo_000,"この地方を巡って
英傑ウルボザの逸話を聞いているうちに…
師匠の未完の詩とは別に
私も彼女を表現してみたくなりました
そこでウルボザが操ったという
この神獣 ヴァ・ナボリスの元で…","Ah! Wandering around here and listening
to anecdotes aboutChampion Urbosa
has truly invigorated me.
In fact, it has inspired me to honor
her in my own way, separate from
my teacher'sunfinished song.
That is why I felt inclined to roost here,
near theDivine Beast Vah Naboris,
whichUrbosa herself mastered."

ありし日の英傑ウルボザの姿を描く詩…","I've written a song...to try and capture
the essence ofChampion Urbosa..."

母性に溢れた女性だったのでしょうね","Hmm... Though she was a fierce warrior,
the Gerudo chief was also a loving friend
of Hyrule's princess."
5,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroGerudo_501,"いかがでしたか？
英傑ウルボザの詩
彼女の強さを詩に出来たことで
師匠に一歩近づけたような気がします","So? What do you think of
Champion Urbosa's Song?

By writing a song that honors the
heart of Champion Urbosa, I feel
closer than ever to my dear teacher."
