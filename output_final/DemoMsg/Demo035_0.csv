come crying to me later."
23,talk05,"ルピーが足りん…
返して欲しければ120ルピー用意するんだな","I know from swindles, boy, and I can

120 rupees required."
24,talk16,ならば… ここを去れ,Then... What are you still doing here?

26,talk18,"俺にハートの器かがんばりの器を
預けてくれたら100ルピー渡そう
もしも器が必要になったら
どちらでも好きな方を120ルピーで返そう
つまり…差額20ルピーで
ハートの器とがんばりの器を交換できるわけだ
どうだ？悪くない話だろう？
さっそく取り引きといこうじゃないか","It's simple.I'll give you100 rupeesto
take one of yourHeart Containersor a
Stamina Vessel off your hands.
You can have one back for120 rupees.
And if it's not the same one you gave
me, why, I won't tell a soul.
Exchanging aHeart Container for a
Stamina Vessel, or vice versa, for only
20 rupeessounds good, doesn't it?
You must be salivating at the idea, so
let's go ahead and strike our bargain."
27,talk20,ハートの器を返してほしいなら120ルピーだ,"The price to return aHeart Container to
you will be120 rupees."
28,talk21,"ハートの器を預け
100ルピーを手に入れるんだな？","I'll gladly pay you100 rupees""for one
of yourHeart Containers. Is that what
you want?"
29,talk22,がんばりの器を返してほしいなら120ルピーだ,"The price to return aStamina Vessel to
you will be120 rupees."
30,talk23,"がんばりの器を預け
100ルピーを手に入れるんだな？","I'll gladly pay you100 rupees""for one

さて どうする？","I have of youressencesso far.
What now, hmmmm?"
32,talk31,器を取り引きしに来たんだろ？,"Come to tamper with youressence, yes?"
33,talk32,"いいえ… か
なかなか いい返事だ
俺の声が聞こえているようなので
話すとしよう","No, eh?Fa ha ha... If you say so.Just know that I'm willing to strike a
bargain with anyone who can hear
my voice."
34,talk33,"俺の手元には まだ器が個あるが…
ハートの器を さらに返してほしいか？","I still have of youressences...
Shall I return anotherHeart Container
to you?"
35,talk34,ハートの器を さらに預けるか？,"I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
me moreHeart Containers."
36,talk35,"俺の手元には まだ器が個あるが…
がんばりの器を さらに返そうか？","I still have of youressences...
Shall I return anotherStamina Vessel
to you?"
37,talk36,がんばりの器を さらに預けるか？,"I wouldn't object if you wanted to give
me moreStamina Vessels."
38,talk37,これ以上ハートの器は減らせないぜ…,"I don't see how you can reduce your
Heart Containersany further."
39,talk38,これ以上がんばりの器は減らせないぜ…,"I don't see how you can reduce your
Stamina Vesselsany further."
40,talk39,これ以上ハートの器は増やせないぜ…,"I don't see how you can increase your
Heart Containersany further."
41,talk40,これ以上がんばりの器は増やせないぜ…,"I don't see how you can increase your
Stamina Vesselsany further."
42,talk41,"おい… それ以上ハートの器を減らすと
命にかかわるぞ","Careful... Give away any more of your
Heart Containers, and it could have a
fatal effect on your health."
43,talk42,"おい… それ以上がんばりの器を減らすと
立てなくなるぞ","Have a care... Give me any more of your
Stamina Vessels, and you may not have
the strength to stand."
44,talk43,おい… それ以上ハートの器は増やせないぞ,"No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
theHeart Containersyou possibly can."
45,talk44,おい… それ以上がんばりの器は増やせないぞ,"No, no... I'm afraid you already have all
theStamina Vesselsyou possibly can."
46,talk45,取り引き成立だ…,Then the bargain is struck!
47,talk47,"今預かっている器は１つもない
買い取ってやろうか？","I'm currently without any of your
essences. Are you in the mood to sell?"
48,talk52,"ほう…
この俺も まだ捨てたもんじゃないな","Ahhhh...So there are some who still
pay me homage."
49,talk53,"まさか… 
俺の声が聞こえるのか？",You don't say... You can hear my voice?
50,talk54,"これはおどろいたな

おまえは何を祈っていた？
命か？ それとも金か？
どちらにしても おまえにとって
この俺は おあつらえ向きだろう","Now, that is a surprise.What were you praying for? Long life? 
Wealth, like so many of your kind?Whichever it was, you came to the
right place."
51,talk57,祈りに来たか…,"You came to pray, then... You want what
everyone wants. Long life and wealth."
52,talk58,…まだ祈り足りないのか？,"What's wrong, then? Have your prayers
gone unanswered?"
53,talk59,フン…,Hmm...
54,talk65,"どうやら腕は鈍っていなかったようだ

無事に おまえの器を
預かることができた","My touch is as subtle as ever...Note how I took thatessence from you
without leaving a mark."
55,talk68,どちらの器を預けるんだ？,"Which type ofessencewill you surrender
to me?"
56,talk69,どちらの器を返すんだ？,Which type ofessenceshall I grant you?
57,talk77,"命と力を司る神…

それが かつての俺だ

その俺が金と命を取り引きしたのが
女神ハイリアのお気に召さなかったらしい
こんな石像に姿を変えられて
はるかな時が過ぎ去った…
村人はこの俺を悪魔の像と呼び
鳥のフンを拭いてくれようともしない
心を入れ替えたのかと言われれば
とんでもない
俺は待っていたのだ

おまえのような
話のわかるやつが現れる時を…
…ああ俺としたことが
久しぶりなので しゃべりすぎたよ","A dealer in life and power...
That was me, once.Alas, my life-for-money bargains didn't
sit well with theGoddess Hylia.She trapped me in this stone statue
long, long ago.The villagers here call me the Horned
Statue and don't even bother to wipe
away the bird droppings.
One would think years upon years of
such treatment would have made me
mend my ways...
One would think wrongly.I have only been biding my time for the
moment someone who can hear me
appears.Someone such as you.
But I've said enough."
58,talk78,"…おまえはそのままでいい
何もしなくていい","Then stay that way. No further action on
your part is required."
59,talk80,"フフフ… どうやら おまえ…

今までハートの器やがんばりの器を
増やした事がないらしいな
器を操作してやりたいが
今のままでは無理だ
女神像に器を増やしてもらってから
また ここに祈りに来るんだな","What's this?You haven't received even one more
Heart ContainerorStamina Vessel?Such a pity... I was eager to help you
with a minortransaction. But not if you
have nothing to trade.
Consult aGoddess Statueto improve
yourself, and then return here to pray."
60,talk82,フフフ…,Fa ha ha...
61,talk84,"…フフフ だまされたと思ったか？

俺はおまえと長い付き合いをしたい
だますなんて とんでもない
さあ どっちにする？","Fa ha ha... Did you think I'd
deceived you?Perish the thought.I hope that ours
will be a long and profitable relationship.
So which will it be?"
62,talk85,"俺は元々命と力を司る神だ

預かった器をハートでもがんばりでも…
おまえのお望みの方で返してやれるのだ","As I may have mentioned once or twice,
I'm a dealer in life and power.I can
provide a valuable service to you.I takeHeart ContainersorStamina
Vesselsfrom you...and then, for a price,
return whichever of the two you like."
63,talk86,どちらの器で返してほしい？,"Which type of essence would you like
in return?"
64,talk87,"よし…
では じっとしてろ","A wise choice. Now, remain still."
65,talk88,"怪訝そうな顔をしているが安心しろ

次からは金の力で
おまえの器を操作してやろう
いいか まずは俺に
どちらかの器を100ルピーで売ってくれ
預けた器を買い戻すなら120ルピーだ

返す時にハートの器かがんばりの器…
好きな方を おまえに選ばせてやろう
器を操作してほしくなったら
いつでも ここに祈りに来い","You look skeptical.Not to worry.Money and life are all as one to me.If you're ready to begin, then first you
must sell me either type ofessencefor
100 rupees.
If you want to buy an essence back,
the price rises to120 rupees.Before you cry foul, know that you may
choose which one I return to you:
aHeart Containeror aStamina Vessel.
I'm eager to help tamper with your
essence anytime you want to return
and pray here."
66,talk89,それじゃあ取り引きといこうか,"Now then, shall we strike a bargain?"
