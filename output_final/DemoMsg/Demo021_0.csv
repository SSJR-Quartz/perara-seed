6,talk00,"着いたぞ！

ここまで高いと流石の俺でも凍えるぜ！","All right. It's showtime.


Man, even I feel like I'm going to freeze
up here!"
7,talk01,"そして… あのデカいのが神獣 ヴァ・メドーだ

フン… またバリアか小賢しい…

どうした リンク？
ビビって声も出ないか？
さ～て""作戦のおさらいをしようか","There'sDivine Beast Vah Medoh.


It has itsbarrier up again.
What a pain...

What's wrong, Link?
Too scared to talk?

Let's go over the plan."
8,talk02,よし！じゃあ砲台を頼んだぞ！,All right.Now go blow up thosecannons!
9,talk03,フム しっかりな,Hnnn. Keep it together.
10,talk04,"おいおい どうした…""本当に戻るのか？","Are you sure? You really want to go
back?"
11,talk05,分かった… ひとまず地上へ戻るとしよう,"Understood. Let's head back to the 
ground for a bit."
12,talk06,準備ができたら行くぞ！,We can move whenever you're ready!
13,talk07,準備は整ったか？だったら行くぞ！,You ready?Let's go.
14,talk08,ふむ… じゃあ行けるか？,You...still good to go?
15,talk09,"前回はやられちまったが今回はそうはいかねぇ
バクダン矢は装備したか？","Last time could have gone better, but
we've got it this time. Are you all good
onbomb arrows?"
16,talk10,"しかし この寒さはキツいな
体が温まるモン食ってから行けよ！","But, man, it's cold. Make sure you eat
something that will warm you upbefore
you go!"
17,talk12,"あの砲台が見えるか？
俺が囮になって砲台の攻撃を引き付ける
その間に おまえがバクダン矢で砲台を壊す
ここまでは OKだな？
一時退避したくなったら布を広げて
ひたすら上昇すれば捕まえて背中に乗せてやる
それからメドーのバリアは狙うだけ無駄だ
近付き過ぎて触るなよ
最後に…""何度も言うが
寒さ対策だけは忘れるなよ","You see thosecannons? I'll draw their
fire.

While I'm doing that, use your
bomb arrowstodestroy the cannons.
Got it so far?
If you need to withdraw for a bit, just
spread your cloth and floatstraight up
in the updraft for a while.
I'll take that as a sign that we need to
regroup.

Don't bother aiming for anything covered
byMedoh's barrier. It's impenetrable.

And whatever you do, don't get close
enough to touch it.

And finally—I know I've said this a few
times already, but don't forget yourcold
protection."
18,talk13,"俺が囮になって砲台の攻撃を引き付ける
おまえがバクダン矢で砲台を壊す…
頼んだぞ","I'll draw thecannonfire. Meanwhile, you
destroy the cannons with your
bomb arrows. And be quick about it."
