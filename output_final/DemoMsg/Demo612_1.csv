1,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroRito_000,"この地方を巡って
英傑リーバルの逸話を聞いているうちに…
師匠の未完の詩とは別に
私も彼を表現してみたくなりました
そこでリーバルが操ったという
この神獣 ヴァ・メドーの元で…","Ah! Wandering around here and listening
to anecdotes aboutChampion Revali
has truly invigorated me.
In fact, it has inspired me to honor
him in my own way, separate from
my teacher'sunfinished song.
That is why I felt inclined to roost here,
near theDivine Beast Vah Medoh,
whichRevalihimself mastered."
2,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroRito_001,"こんな詩を作ってみました
ありし日の英傑リーバルの姿を描く詩…","I've written a song...to try and capture
the essence ofChampion Revali..."
3,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroRito_100,"♪これは""メドーを繰りし者が
未だ英傑と""呼ばれる前の物語
その名はリーバル… リトの戦士
村訪れし姫の はるか頭上で…","♪RecallMedoh's""Champion of flight,
before he fellto his fateful plight.♪

♪Revali's featwas a wonder to see,
so the princessmade her plea.♪"
4,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroRito_500,"…我がリトの英傑は どうやら
素直な人ではなかったようですね","Hmm... It seems theRito Champion
was not one to share his feelings."
5,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroRito_501,"いかがでしたか？
英傑リーバルの詩
彼の内面を詩に出来たことで
師匠に一歩近づけたような気がします","So? What do you think of
Champion Revali's Song?

By writing a song that highlights the
hidden feelings of Champion Revali, I feel
closer than ever to my dear teacher."
