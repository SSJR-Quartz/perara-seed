1,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk000,"ここまでやれるとは正直思ってなかったよ
リーバルの猛りも さらに強化されたわけで…","I truly never imagined you would do
so well. Regardless, Revali's Gale
should be more efficient than ever."
2,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk010,"今の君なら出来るだろ？
ガノン討伐っていう大仕事をね","As you are, I guess it's theoretically
possible for you to best Ganon."
3,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk100,"おや また来たのか
厄災ガノンに向かう前の訓練ってわけ？","You're back? Hmph. I suppose this is
part of your training to defeat
Calamity Ganon, yes?"
4,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk110,"まあ君が ガノン討伐を不安に思うのも
わからないじゃないけど…","I can't blame you for feeling anxious
about facing the foul beast."
5,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk120,"あれ？ ひょっとして僕のこの美声で
激励してほしくなったとか？","Hm? Were you looking for words of
encouragement in my dulcet tones?"
6,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk130,"それもまあ わからないでもないけど
僕が見守ってるってだけで十分だろ？","I can understand why you would desire
such a thing, but having me keep you
in line will have to suffice."
7,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk200,また来たのかい？,You again?
8,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk210,"ところでさ…君 リトの村に行ったよね？
様子はどうだった？","Well, since you're here, tell me...
How is Rito Village faring?"
9,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk220,"ここから見る分には皆
上手くやってるようだけど…","Everyone seems to be doing well,
as far as I can tell."
10,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk230,"まあ あれから100年経っちゃってる
僕を知ってる奴は もういないだろ","I can't fathom that it's been 100 years...
There's no one left who would even
know me."
11,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk240,"…でも気になるよね
故郷だからね…","But even so, it will always be my home."
12,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk300,"君も頑張るね…
ああ そうだ","You're working diligently. As you should.
By the way, a word of advice."
13,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk310,"あの姫を助けた後に…
あんまり僕の事を聞き出そうとしちゃ駄目だよ？","After you rescue the princess, don't go
asking her about me. Understood?"
14,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk320,いや！姫が何を言ったとしてもだ！,"Whatever rubbish she may say,
do NOT pursue that topic!"
15,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk330,"もう100年も前の話だからねえ
さすがに姫の記憶も曖昧なんじゃないかな？","It's been 100 years, so I bet her royal
memory isn't what it used to be anyhow."
16,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk400,君もしつこいね…,You're rather persistent.
17,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk410,"まあ ちょうど良かった
もう一つ言い忘れていた事があるんだ…","Well, at least you have good timing.
There's something I wanted to tell you."
18,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk420,"もしもどこかで リトの戦士 リーバルの日記…
なんてものを君が手に入れたとしてもだ…","You may happen upon something called
\""The Diary of Revali, the Rito Legend.\"""
19,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk430,"それに書かれている事は全部デタラメだ！
そいつを書いたのは僕じゃないからね？","Don't believe a word of it! I'm not the
author. Misleading title, I know."
20,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk440,いいね？！,Got it?
21,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk500,"ああ後悔先に立たず…
君と僕とは 100年前に戦っておくべきだったよ","*sigh* It's pointless to dwell on the past.
Still... You and I should have fought
100 years ago."
22,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk510,"リトの村に現れた君と この僕との一騎打ち！
それは つまり…","A duel against the one who came to
Rito Village to challenge my authority.
Just imagine..."
23,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk520,"ハイラル最強の騎士と リト族一番の戦士による
世紀の大一番！ って事になるんだぜ？","The hero of the Rito against Hyrule's
mightiest knight! A battle for the ages!"
24,Npc_Rito_Hero_talk530,"勝っても負けても…
君とは決着を付けたかったよ…","Win or lose, I would have liked a chance
to settle the score with you..."
