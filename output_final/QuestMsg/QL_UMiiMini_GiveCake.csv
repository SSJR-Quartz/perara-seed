ハルリは ケーキしか食べてくれない娘ハーニーに
手を焼いているようだ
娘が回復してくれるなら魔物に魂を売ってでも
様々なケーキを手に入れるつもりらしい

彼女が今まで見た事も無いようなケーキは
どこに行ったら見つかるのだろう？","You overheard a fight between Hagie and Ruli,
husband and wife. Their daughter Hunnie is sick
and won't get better if she doesn't eat. But the
thing is, the only food she has an appetite for is
cake, and finding a particular cake to please her
has proven nearly impossible. Ruli is at her wit's
end, ready to even trade her soul to amonster
if it means finding a cake her daughter will eat.

Where are you going to find a suitablecake?"
2,QL_UMiiMini_GiveCake_Finish,"ハルリにマモノケーキを渡した！
そして たっぷりお礼をもらった！

ハルリの娘ハーニーは
すっかり元気を取り戻し
外で遊べるくらいに回復したようだ","You were generously rewarded for giving Ruli
a monster cake.

Her daughter Hunnie seems to have made
a full recovery, well enough even to play
outside again."

ケーキしか食べてくれない娘ハーニーは
無事マモノケーキを食べてくれたようだ

ハーニーがどうなったのか
ハルリに話しかけてみよう！","You gave Ruli a monster cake!

Her sick daughter, Hunnie, who has not
had an appetite for anything but cake
lately, was able to eat it.

Check in withRuli to find out how Hunnie
is doing."
