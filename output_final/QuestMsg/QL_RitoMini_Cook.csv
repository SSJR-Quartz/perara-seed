1,QL_RitoMini_Cook_Desc,"リトの村にハネムーンに来たジュノーだが
求める物はここには無く たいそうご立腹だ

しかし大好きな焼きリンゴを食べれば
機嫌を直してくれるらしい

離婚を防ぐためにも
焼きリンゴを持って行ってあげよう！","Juney, currently in Rito Village on her
honeymoon, is about to blow her stack
if she can't find what she's looking for.

Distracting her from her troubles with
abaked apple, her favorite snack,
is one way to lighten the mood.

Bring Juney abaked apple and save
her marriage!"

焼きリンゴを渡した！

ジュノーが言うには焼きリンゴは別腹 とのことだ

焼きリンゴをたくさん作って
まとめて持って行ってあげよう！","You gave Juney, currently honeymooning in
Rito Village, a baked apple. She was so
grateful that she paid you a few rupees for
the service.

Juney told you that she'll never turn down
abaked apple. If you gather any more,
bring them directly to her!"
