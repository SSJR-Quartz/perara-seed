腕の立ちそうな客を見つけては
ちょっかいを かけている

「村の女神像の近くにある燭台に火を灯して…」
明るい笑顔と裏腹に彼女のリクエストは
一筋縄では いかなさそうだ","When Rola, owner of the general store, judged
you as a capable archer, she wasted no time
recruiting you for a seemingly simple job.

All she asked was that you \""light the torches
by the Goddess Statue\"" in the village, but her
suspiciously sweet smile made it clear that
this task would require unconventional methods."

セローラの情熱にも火をつけたようだ

旦那と よりを戻す日は
そう遠くはないかもしれない","In lighting the torches, you seem to have also
ignited Rola's passion. The day that she
can reunite with her husband may not be so
far off."

萬屋の店主 セローラの依頼どおり
燭台に火をつけた
さっそく報告しに行こう","\""Light the torches by the Goddess Statue.\""

You did as Rola asked and lit the torches.
Go to her general store and tell her that
what she requested is done."
