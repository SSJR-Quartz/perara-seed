骨の馬の魔物を一目見たいという

見せるには どうすれば良いだろうか？

骨の馬の魔物は北タバンタ雪原や
その東にある ケッタイな遺跡の周辺に現れるようだ","Juannelle in the Snowfield Stable wants to see
what aStalhorse looks like.

What would be the best way to show her?

She's heard that the Stalhorse appears in the
eastern part of N. Tabantha Snowfield, in the
area surrounding some strange ruins."

イチヨウは器用に模写してみせた

その絵を使って記事を書くらしい
良い記事になりそうと喜んでくれた","When you showed the picture of the Stalhorse
to Juannelle, she carefully traced it so she'd
have her own copy.

It seems she plans on using the picture in an
article she's writing. With the picture for
inspiration, she's excited to get to work!"
