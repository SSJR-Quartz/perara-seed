しかし最近馬に乗った荒くれ者たちに
占拠されてしまい ソエは悲しんでいる

荒くれ者たちを退治できれば
ソエに笑顔が戻るかもしれない","Faron Grasslands is known for its horses.

However, a gang of heathens has taken over
the area lately. This has caused Perosa and the

If someone were willing to take on this group of
hoodlums, it would definitely cheer up Perosa."

Perosa was so happy with the news, she gave

hard work.
