サクラダ工務店の社長 サクラダに

薪の束を30本集めて持っていこう！","You can buy a house in Hateno Village!

Bolson, president of Bolson Construction,
offered to slash his original asking price of
50,000 rupees down to3,000 rupees if you
also throw in 30 bundles of wood.

What are you waiting for? Gather the wood
and bring it to him!"

knickknacks, and your house is finally a home.

Bolson seems pretty relieved to have finished
such a big job."

部屋には何も無いので
サクラダがオマケで
武器スタンドを据えつけてくれたようだ

しかし家の中はまだまだカラッポだ
サクラダに話せば何とかしてくれるかもしれない","You bought a house in Hateno Village for
3,000 rupees! Bolson generously furnished
a weapon rack inside your empty home as a
housewarming gift.

The place is still pretty bare, though. If you
talk to Bolson, he might be able to help you
with that."
