王家の料理に興味を持った馬宿のゴエタフ

ハイラル城の中に もしかしたら
料理レシピに関する文献が残っているかもしれない","Gotter, a beautiful man who works the stables,
has become completely infatuated with the
cuisine once favored by the Hyrulean royal
family. Eating it has been his lifelong dream
ever since learning one of his ancestors was
a chef in Hyrule Castle.

Some old cookbooks may still be lying around
Hyrule Castle."
