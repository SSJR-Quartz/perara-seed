 その獣に跨る時勇者の試練が姿を現す』

カッシーワから教えてもらった
古の詩の謎を解き勇者の試練を見つけ出そう","\""A beast that wears a crown of bone,
Prancing through the lush green.
Mount the beast upon its throne, 
For only then the shrine is seen.\""

This is a song that Kass sang.
Solve the song's riddle to find the
shrine."

二本の槍携えし獣とは ヤマシカのことだった

ヤマシカに跨ってレリーフに乗り
古代の祠を出現させた！","\""A beast that wears a crown of bone,
Prancing through the lush green.
Mount the beast upon its throne, 
For only then the shrine is seen.\""

The beast wearing a crown of bone was a
mountain buck.

As the song instructed, being atop a mountain
buck while it stood on the pedestal caused the
shrine to appear."
