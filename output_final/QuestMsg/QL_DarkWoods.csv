1,QL_DarkWoods_Desc,"一寸先も見えない広い遺跡に到着すると
何者かの声が聞こえた

昼間でも真っ暗なこの遺跡に
勇者の試練が隠されているしい","When you arrived in the ruins shrouded in
darkness, a strange voice spoke out to you.

It would seem that a shrine is hidden
somewhere within the ruins, though it may prove
challenging to search a place that is pitch black,
even during the day."
2,QL_DarkWoods_Finish,"何者かがドイブラン遺跡に作り上げた
暗闇の試練

最深部に潜むヒノックスから
珠を奪い台座にはめると
古代の祠が出現した","Someone built this challenge within the
Thyphlo Ruins.

When you stole the object from the Hinox
hidden in the depths of the ruins and placed
it on the pedestal, a shrine appeared!"
