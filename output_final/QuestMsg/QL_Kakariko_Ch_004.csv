1,QL_Kakariko_Ch_004_Desc,"カカリコ村は知る人ぞ知るホタルの名所
闇夜に輝くホタルの光は まるで星々の輝きのよう…

服屋の看板娘 ラズリは大のホタル好き
しかし夜は出歩いてはいけないと
祖母からキツク言われている…
「ホタルが部屋に遊びに来てくれたらなぁ…」
ラズリの願いは叶うのだろうか","Kakariko Village is famous for its fireflies.
Watching their faint glow in the night air is
a bit like gazing at the night sky.

Lasli, the clothes-shop barker, is a huge firefly
fan. But she's under strict orders from her
grandmother not to walk outside late at night.

\""If only the fireflies came to play here so I could
still see them...\"" Can you make Lasli's wish
come true?"

大好きなホタルを家で愛でることができ
笑顔を取り戻したようだ","Kakariko Village is famous for its fireflies.
Watching their faint glow in the night air is

Lasli, the clothes-shop barker, is a huge firefly
fan. Now that she can see her favorite sight
from the comfort of home, she's happy again."
