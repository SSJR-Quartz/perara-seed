1,QL_Gerudo_CarryIce_Desc,"古代の祠の前でパクトという
ゲルド人が倒れていた
彼女を元気にさせなければ
中には入れなさそうだ
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイが飲みたいと
うわ言のように つぶやいている","A Gerudo named Pokki has collapsed in front
of the ancient shrine. You'll have to find a way
to revive her if you want to get inside. She was
barely coherent, but it sounded like she was
muttering about wanting to drink something
calledNoble Pursuit."
2,QL_Gerudo_CarryIce_Gerudo_CarryIce_Delivered,"酒場の主に氷を届けた

これでキンキンに冷えた
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイが作れるだろう
古代の祠で倒れているパクトに
この事を早く伝えてあげよう","You delivered the ice to the owner of
the canteen.

She's now able to make ice-cold Noble Pursuits.
She's asked that you go back to Pokki and let
her know that a drink is waiting for her.
Pokki had collapsed in front of the shrine."
3,QL_Gerudo_CarryIce_Gerudo_CarryIce_Finished,"キンキンに冷えたヴァーイミーツヴォーイの事を
パクトに伝えたところ
ゲルド酒場に飛んで行ってしまった

これでゆっくり
古代の祠に入れそうだ","When you told Pokki about the ice-cold Noble
Pursuit, she flew off in the direction of the
Gerudo canteen.

You can enter the shrine anytime you want."
4,QL_Gerudo_CarryIce_Gerudo_CarryIce_Get,"アンチェから氷を分けてもらった！

砂漠の暑さで溶けないように注意しながら
遺跡で待ち合わせているフロスの所まで
氷を運ぶ必要がありそうだ","You got Anche to give you some ice!

You now have to carry the ice back to Furosa,
who waits at the exit of the ruins north of town.
With the blazing heat of the desert, it'll be a 
challenge toget back without the ice melting."
5,QL_Gerudo_CarryIce_Gerudo_CarryIce_bar,"ヴァーイミーツヴォーイはゲルド酒場の
名物酒だった
しかし今は氷を切らしていて作れないという

街の北にある氷室にいるアンチェから
氷を分けてもらおう
ただし明るい内に行く必要がありそうだ","Noble Pursuit is a famous drink from the
Gerudo canteen. Unfortunately, it can't be
made right now because they're all out of ice.

You'll need to go to the icehouse north of
Gerudo Town and ask Anche to give you some
ice. You can only get Anche's help while it's
bright out, though."
