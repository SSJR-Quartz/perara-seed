I, Trello, shall punish you on behalf of
our beloved Lady Mipha!

*ahem* That's what I'd like to do,
anyhow.

But I'm afraid those of us in the Zora

figure out what to do next about Ruta."

くれてやったらええゾラ","The ceremonial trident is used in a 
festival to honor Champion Mipha...

The Champion Festival's
Lightscale Trident...
Well, it's a fake.
I planned to have that ceremonial trident
examined by Dento, but on the way
there, I dropped it off the bridge.
It doesn't really matter. It's a fake,
after all... I'll have to ask Dento to
make a new one.
If someone happens to pick it up,
they can just keep it."

Lightscale Trident. It is used in the

At first glance, the metal used looks the
same as that of the Lightscale Trident.

里の子が よく歌っとるやつじゃ
興味があるなら聞いてみるがよい","That ceremonial trident you're holding...
In addition to its combat use, it has the
same power as the Lightscale Trident.
Originally, the Lightscale Trident was
meant to lead the hero to a trial...
At least, according to the legend.
I believe the Champion Festival Song's
lyrics mention this...

If you find a child who loves songs,
he or she might know it."

After you left, I remembered the legend.


A gift from the sky...a scale of light...
Splits the feet...of a Veiled Falls sight...
Your trial awaits...it's glowing bright...
...


At Veiled Falls, there is a pedestal
just like the one Lady Mipha's statue
rests upon.
The legend indicates that you must
thrust the Lightscale Trident into the
same place as the statue of Lady Mipha.
We tried to do just that long ago, but
nothing happened.

Perhaps someone with the Champion's
talents might have better luck..."
32,talk27,"祭事の槍の調子は どうゾラ？

祭事の槍が壊れたり無くしたりしたら
