generated in the two humps on that
thing's back.
There seems to be an entrance or
somethin' under the tail, so you could
maybe get in that way, but...
It's super high up, and it shoots lightnin'
at you, so...

It definitely wouldn't be easy to just go
inside—that's for sure.

But if someone entangled its legs and
tripped it, that'd work out really well...

Wait, I shouldn't be tellin' you this! It's
my info! You should earn information
usin' your own two feet!"

some tough times. I barely got away from
that big thing in the desert...
But after all the danger to get here, this
soldier won't even give me the time
of day, much less let me in!"
19,Talk_203,"なんや姉ちゃん…

investigative journalist, after all!

Truth is, you can't hide anything from
Traysi!"
