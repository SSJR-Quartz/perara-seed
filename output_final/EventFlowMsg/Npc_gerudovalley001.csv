5,Talk_0001,"やっぱり また来たな…

馬宿をやってると
色んな客がくるんでな
取引してくれそうな客かどうかは
見ただけでわかるんだよ
…で例のブツは
持ってきてくれたのかい？","I knew you'd be back. Run a stable as
long as I have and you can tell which
folks will be repeat customers.
So did you bring me the stuff?"
6,Talk_02,ゴー…… ゴー……,Zzzz... Zzzz...

8,Talk_20,"へへっ いつも助かるよ…

all you brought, though?You're not...holding out on me, are you?"
9,Talk_21,"へへつ

長年馬宿やって色んな客を見て来たからな

俺に隠し事しようたって
そうはいかないぜ
さぁ見せてみな
","Heh heh. If there's one thing I've learned
after running this stable all these years,
it's how to read people.
There's no point in trying to keep
anything from me. Go ahead and show
me what you've got."
10,Talk_22,"俺の取引単位は55からだ…
少ない数じゃないし まぁ仕方ないな
取引は相場のおよそ倍…

へへっ 
俺はいつでもここで待ってるぜ","I will only take them in bulk, in units
of 55 each. That's a good number, eh?

Take your time getting some. 
I'll be waiting here, heh heh."
