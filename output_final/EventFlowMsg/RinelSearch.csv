13,talk00,…こんにちは,Hello.
14,talk01,…こんばんは,Good evening.
15,talk02,…はい,Oh!
16,talk03,あなたは…リンクさんですね,You are Link...right?
17,talk04,"シド王子が…
ハイリア人のリンクと神獣を止めに行くぞ！
…と叫んでいましたからね

という事は あなたは雷獣山に電気の矢を
取りに行かれる という事ですね？","Prince Sidon ran off through the
eastern gate. He was shouting
something like...\""I'm off to stop the Divine Beast!
Link the Hylian is coming with me!\""

I assume that means you're going
up Ploymus Mountain in search of
shock arrows?"
18,talk05,"そうですか
私の思い違いだったようです…",Oh. My mistake.
19,talk06,だったら ついでのお願いがあるのです,"If so, I have a request that is...
somewhat related."
20,talk07,"あの山が雷獣山です

ライネルという赤いたてがみを持つ
魔物が棲みついているそうです
あの山にいるライネルでも
他の場所にいるものでも良いので
とにかくライネルの姿を
私に見せてもらえませんか？","There's a red-maned monster called a
Lynel that lives on Ploymus Mountain.

I REALLY need a picture of a Lynel.
It can be a picture of any red-maned
Lynel. Not just the one on the mountain.
So what do you say? Can you get me 
a picture of a Lynel?"
21,talk08,リンクさん…雷獣山に行くんですよね？,"Link... You are on your way to climb
Ploymus Mountain, correct?"
22,talk09,"話が早くて助かります
",I am glad that was settled so quickly.
23,talk11,"あの雷獣山には赤いたてがみを持つ
半人半馬の魔物""ライネルが棲んでいます
過去に何人もの村の若者が
ライネルの犠牲に なっています
どうか お気をつけて…","You have probably already heard, but up
on Ploymus Mountain there lives a Lynel.
This creature is half man, half beast.
In the past, a number of Zora from
the domain have fallen prey to this
red-maned Lynel...
It is not to be underestimated.
Please be careful."
24,talk12,すいません今移動中ですので…,"Sorry, but I'm on my way somewhere...
at least I hope I am."
25,talk13,"すいません唐突すぎましたね
もう少し咀嚼してお話ししましょう","I'm sorry. I know that was a bit sudden.
Allow me to elaborate."
26,talk14,"あそこに見える山は雷獣山といいます

雷獣山にはライネルという
赤いたてがみを持つ強い魔物が棲んでいます
私はライネルの姿が見たいのです

姿を見ることが大事なので なんなら
他の場所にいるライネルでも構いません
…これで理解しましたか？","That peak over there is known as
Ploymus Mountain.

On top of Ploymus Mountain is a brutal,
red-maned monster called a Lynel.

It's so very important that I see one.
Any Lynel with a red mane will do.
It doesn't have to be that specific one.
Does that make more sense?"
27,talk15,"良かった…
ちょっとどうしようかと思いました","That's good to hear. I was a little worried
about what to do."
28,talk16,"これでも理解できませんか…
では子供でも分かるように説明しますね","Really? You...still don't get it?!
OK...I will try explaining it like
I would to a child."
29,talk17,"あの雷獣山は見えまちゅか？
尖ってまちゅね～？
あそこにはライネルという赤い毛が生えた
魔物が棲んでまちゅ！こわいでちゅね～！
私はどうしても
ライネルの姿が見たいんでちゅ♪
なんなら他の場所にいるのでもいいでちゅよ
ライネルの姿を見れるのが大事でちゅ！
でも本物は連れて来ないでね♪
怖いらしいでちゅからね～♪
なので本物じゃなくていいから
ライネルの姿を見れないでちゅかね～？
…理解しましたか？","Does baby see dat really big rock over
dere? Dat's called Ploymus Mountain!
Yes it is!
A big, scawy monster with red hair lives
there. It's called a Lynel, and I really,
REALLY want to see what one looks like!
But they're NOT VERY NICE, so I don't
want you to bring him down here
because he might be mean to us!
Maybe you could draw me a pretty
picture of what a Lynel looks like
instead? Any red-maned Lynel at all?
*ahem* There... Do you understand now?"
30,talk19,"というのも雷獣山の先端に
試しの岬と呼ばれる突き出た崖があるのですが
そこから東の貯水湖に飛び込む遊びを推奨する
不埒な輩がこのゾーラの里に居りまして…
そんなわけで雷獣山に居る魔物…
ライネルの姿を口伝すれば
試しの岬には近づかなくなるだろうと
思ったのです
それではリンクさん","See, there's this fool in the domain who
goads people into jumping off of
Shatterback Point on Ploymus Mountain.
It's an incredibly dangerous jump, and
this guy pressures people into jumping
off by questioning their courage.
He's a real bottom-feeder. If this keeps
up, someone is surely going to wind up
horribly injured!
I need a picture of a Lynel to show
everyone how scary they are. That way,
maybe people will stop going up there.
Does that answer your question, Link?"
31,talk20,"手段はお任せします
ライネルの姿…お願いしますよ","I'll leave the details to you. Just bring me
a picture of a Lynel so I can describe
them in terrible detail. Thank you!"
32,talk21,"ひょっとして私
雷獣山への行き方を言ってなかったかも…","I may have failed to mention how to get
up on Ploymus Mountain..."
33,talk22,"ではライネルの姿を…
頼みましたよ","So you'll show me what a Lynel looks
like? Thank you in advance!"
34,talk23,"雷獣山へは滝登りが便利です

ゾーラの鎧を着れば ハイリア人でも
滝の下から上まで あっという間ですよ","The waterfall will come in handy when
trying to climb Ploymus Mountain.

Just put on some Zora armor. With that,
even a Hylian can swim up the waterfall
like it's nothing."
35,talk24,"…

あっ でもゾーラの鎧は""王家の娘が
将来の婿に差し上げる特別なモノ…
どなたかに お借りできないでしょうか","...


Oh, but what am I saying? Zora armor
is a sacred gift given by a Zora princess
to her future husband.
Pretty tough to come across otherwise."
36,talk25,"というか そんなに都合よく
ゾーラの鎧…持って無いですよね…
あれを着れば
滝なんか あっという間に登れるんですが…","Don't tell me you just happen to have 
access to sacred Zora armor?!

No...that would be impossible.


Too bad! If you had that armor, you'd be
able to swim straight up waterfalls!"
37,talk26,"リンクさん…
ライネルの姿は…","Link! How is that Lynel mission
coming along?"
38,talk27,おおっ…！それでは早速…,"Oh, wow! Please show me!"
39,talk29,…おはようございます,Good morning.
40,talk30,"ありがとうございます…
この恐怖を里の若者に伝えていこうと思います","Thank you! I'll tell the children of the
domain about this. Maybe that will
scare them away from the mountain."
41,talk31,"このゾーラのすねあては大昔のゾーラ王が
当時の職人に作らせたのが広まったものです
東の貯水湖は ハイリア人とゾーラ族が協力して
建造した施設なのは ご存じでしょうか…
その東の貯水湖の完成後友好の証として
里を訪れるハイリア人用にと作り始めたのです
しかし ここを訪れるハイリア人は年々減少し
ついに父の防具屋は閉店してしまいました
その防具屋が閉店する時に倉庫で眠っていた
最後の一つが今お渡しした物なのです
これを履けば ハイリア人でも
私達ゾーラ族の様に スイスイ泳げるそうです
私が持っていても宝の持ち腐れですし
ハイリア人のあなたが使ってこそ役立つはず
どうか大事に使ってくださいね","These Zora greaves were once made by
skilled craftsmen by order of an ancient
Zora king. Now they're fairly common.
As you may know, East Reservoir Lake
was created in a collaboration between
Hylians and the Zora.
After East Reservoir Lake was finished,
we made Zora greaves as a token of
friendship for Hylians who came to visit.
But over time, the number of Hylians
visiting the domain dwindled, and my
father had to close his armor shop.
These Zora greaves here were the last
pair left in the stock room when he
closed up shop.
Wearing these, even a Hylian can swim
as well as a Zora.

That said, these would be wasted on me.
They are only useful for a Hylian like you.

Please take good care of them!"
42,talk32,"…と思ったのですが
リンクさん ポーチが一杯のようですね
防具ポーチに空きを作ってから
もう一度来て下さい","Well, that's what I was thinking...
But it looks like your pouch is
too full, Link.
Come back once you free up some space
in there!"
43,talk33,"リンクさんライネルの姿
ありがとうございました","Link! Thank you so much for helping me
out with that Lynel mission!"
44,talk34,そうだお礼を…,"Oh, right! Now for your reward..."
45,talk35,"リンクさん…
神獣のことで大変な時ですが
あなたにしか頼めない お願いがあるのです","Link... I am sorry to ask this of you
when you are busy dealing with the
Divine Beast...
But I am afraid this is a task that only
you can accomplish!"
46,talk36,"リンクさん…
神獣は鎮まりましたが この里にはまだ危険が…","Link... The Divine Beast has been
appeased, but I fear there is still
something that threatens the domain..."
47,talk37,"ん…
やはり リンクさんに頼むのは筋違いですね
失礼致しました
私のことは気にしないで下さい","Hmm... I suppose it was wrong of me
to ask this of you.

My apologies. Please don't concern
yourself with my troubles."
48,talk39,"そういえば リンクさん…
どこでそのゾーラの鎧を手に入れたのですか？
まさか ミファー様の…","By the way, Link... How did you get
your hands on that Zora armor?

I thought Lady Mipha was saving that
for the man she... OH."
