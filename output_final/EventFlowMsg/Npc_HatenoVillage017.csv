13,talk03,それじゃあね…,See you later.
14,talk04,"ああ それそれその青い炎…
なんで君が持ってるのか わからないけど
久しぶりに復活ってことかな？","Carrying the blue flame, I see. It's been
a while since I've seen anyone rekindle
it. Is it finally back for good?"
15,talk05,"青い炎を運ぶのは若者に任せちゃった…
って感じなのかな？","Huh. I always thought if anyone would
carry the blue flame, it would be the
director, not some wandering youth."
16,talk06,僕は今から仕事さ…,It's about time I started work...
17,talk07,"僕は今から寝るんだよ
夜はずっと働いてるからね","It's bedtime for me. I spend nights

nights and days are switched for me.
So please let me sleep just a bit more."
20,talk10,"君こそどうしたんだい？
こんな夜中に","Funny, that was going to be my question
to you! What are you doing skulking
around in the dead of night?"
21,talk11,"ははは迷子か… 

まぁ人というのは誰しも人生の森の迷子…
みたいなものだからね","Hahaha, really? Well, they say everyone
is lost in the woods of life. Or words
to that effect."
22,talk12,"宿屋なら坂を下った橋の向こうだよ

僕も よく知らないんだけど…
ハテノ古代研究所の所長さんが
青い炎を灯しているのを見た事があるよ","This? Good question. I'm not quite
sure myself.But apparently the director at the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab lights it
with a blue flame."
26,talk16,"ハテノ古代研究所なら この坂をずっと上って
さらに小高い丘の上さ
煙突から常に煙が出てる あそこだよ

変わり者の爺さん婆さんしかいないから
子供以外は誰も近づかないけどね","The Hateno Ancient Tech Lab is at the
top of this hill. Mark the smoke pouring
from the chimney, and you'll find it.
Nobody lives there but a weird old man
and a strange old lady. Only the kids in
town are foolish enough to go near it."
27,talk17,"ごらんの通り風車の番をしているんだ
愛する妻と二人でね
…あ愛する妻は今 ここにはいないよ
愛する妻と交代で… っていう意味なんだ
あまりに僕の愛が強すぎるから
交代制にして会う時間を少なくしてるんだよ","What's it look like? I'm keeping watch
over the windmills. My devoted wife and
I stand guard day and night.
She's not here right now, I mean. It's
more of a...time-sharing sort of thing.My love for her is so powerful that she
suggested we take shifts. That way it
feels more special when we're together!"
28,talk18,"風車の番を してるんだよ

風車が同じスピードで回ってくれないと
粉のひき具合に ムラができるからね","I'm watching the windmills. They have
to maintain a steady speed or the
consistency of the flour will be off."
29,talk19,"昔ハテノ古代研究所の所長さんが
青い炎を灯しているのを見た事があるけど
なぜ火をつけてるか…
誰が聞いても教えてくれなかったそうだよ","I saw the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab
director lighting the blue flame long
ago, but I never found out why.
She never was one for explaining herself
to ordinary folks."
30,talk20,"はいはい泥棒さん

ちなみに ウチには盗むようなものは
ほとんど無いからね
あるとしてもそれは僕のこの胸から
あふれてこぼれた妻への愛だけさ","Sure, robber man, sure. You're wasting
your time here; we have nothing worth
stealing.
My most valuable possession is my
wife's boundless love for me."
31,talk21,"迷子と言われても
僕はここから動けないしなぁ…
宿屋ならいつでも開いてるから
とりあえず行ってみるといいよ","Be that as it may, I'm in no position to
show you around. But the inn is always open. You might
try them."
32,talk22,"以前はハテノ古代研究所の所長さんが
道端のしょく台に つけて回ってたな","It was once a common sight to see the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab's director go
around setting the lanterns alight."

もう ご高齢だろうから","The Hateno Ancient Tech Lab's
director has to be getting up there
