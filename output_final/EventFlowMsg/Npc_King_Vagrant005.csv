8,ClearTerrorEnemy,むう…,Hmm...
9,GoodBye00,祠のお宝楽しみにしておるぞ,"I look forward to seeing what type of
treasure you secure out there."
10,GoodBye01,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
パラセールが欲しかったら がんばることじゃ","Oho ho! If you still wish to acquire the
paraglider, you must put in the effort.
I will not simply give it away, you see."
11,GoodBye02,"むう…
用もないのに起こすでないぞ","Hmph! Please do not wake me up for
no reason. I need my rest."
12,Hadaka00,え… わしか？！,What in the blazes is going on...
13,Kari00,"見てわからんか？
わしは狩りを しとるんじゃ…
そんなところに立たれたら獲物に気づかれるわ
しゃがんで静かにしてくれないか","Can you not see that I'm hunting here?


You'll scare off my prey like that. At least
crouch down a bit."
14,Kari02,早く しゃがんでくれんかのう…,"Go on! Hurry up and crouch down before
you scare off my prey!"
15,Kari03,"狩りじゃと言ったろう…
しゃがみ過ぎて腰が痛うなってきたわ","Hunting demands a great deal of focus...
It keeps your mind off how much your
back hurts from crouching all day."
16,Kari04,"静かにせいと言うに…
狩りをしとると言ったろう","Quiet, please. I'm still hunting."
17,KariKotsu00,"狩りは剣でもできんことはないが
獲物の動きは素早いからのう…
まずは離れて狙うことのできる
弓を手に入れることじゃな
コツを聞くのは それからじゃ","It is not impossible to hunt with a sword,
but wild prey can be quite fast...

I would suggest getting your hands on a
bow and some arrows, so you can take
shots from afar.
We can discuss technique after that."
18,KariKotsu01,"まずは獲物に気づかれぬよう
しゃがんで静かに近づいてじゃな…
気づかれるかどうかの ギリギリまで近づいたら
素早く矢を放つのがコツじゃ
上手くすれば一発で仕留められるぞ
どこを狙えばいいかは よく考えることじゃ","First, crouch down and approach your
prey quietly to ensure you will not
be noticed.
When you're close enough that detection
is nearly imminent...draw your bow and
let your arrow fly!
Aim thoughtfully, and you should be
able to take down your prey with a
single arrow."
19,KariKotsu02,"お主… わしの弓を持っておるようじゃな
よし弓の腕を見せてみるがいい","Courageous one... I see you have taken
possession of my old bow. Splendid.
Now, let's see what you can do with it."
20,KariKotsu03,"わしは ちょっと疲れたのでな…
少し休むとしよう","I am rather tired... Yes, I think I'm going
to take a small break."
21,KariKotsu04,"腰が痛うなってきたのでな…
今日の狩りは しまいじゃよ","Blast it all! My back is acting up again...
I suppose that means this old man has
had enough hunting for one day."
22,NakedPlayer,裸とな…,Aren't you...a bit chilly?
23,Near00,ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ,Oho ho!
24,Near01,獲物は どこだ…,Where did my prey go...
25,Near02,忍び足…忍び足…,Quietly...
26,Near03,Zzz... Zzz...,Zzz...
27,Near04,……,...
28,Sleep00,"明日も早い…
お主も ここで休んでいくがいい","I must rise early tomorrow... You may
rest here too, if you wish."
29,Sleep01,"ひまをつぶすには
たき火が一番じゃな…","Sitting by a warm campfire is the best
way to pass the time..."
30,Sleep03,"獲物が獲れんかったら
寝るしかないじゃろう？","If I can't hunt, what else is there to do
but sleep?"
31,Takibi00,"腰が痛うて たまらんのでな…
休憩中じゃ","My back is aching... I clearly need to
take a little break."
32,Takibi01,"して お主…腹は減っておらんか？
わしの料理鍋好きに使うてもいいぞ","Say, courageous one... Are you hungry?
If so, please feel free to use my cooking
pot to whip up a snack."
33,Takibi02,"料理がしたいなら
わしの料理鍋好きに使うてもいいぞ","If you feel like cooking, you are welcome
to use my cooking pot over there."
34,Takibi03,"わしの料理鍋なら好きに使うてもいいぞ
また センスのいい料理を作るがいい","Use my cooking pot as much as you like.
Just remember to be smart about how
you combine your ingredients!"
35,Takibi05,"火なら そっちの たき火から
移してくれたらいいからのう","If you need to start a fire, just light your
torch on that campfire over there."
36,Talk00,うん？ なんじゃ？,Hm? What is it?
37,Talk01,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
また会うたな","Well, well, well... So we meet again."
38,Talk02,"のう お主…
いつまで そんな格好でおるつもりじゃ","Just a question, not a judgment...
but how long were you planning on
walking around like that?"
39,Talk03,どいた どいた,Out of the way!
40,Talk04,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
また獲物に逃げられてしもうたわい","Oho ho! Some days the prey is a bit too
fast for this old hunter."
41,Talk05,"お主に狩場を荒らされたおかげで
何も獲れんかったわい…","With you causing such a commotion
in my hunting grounds lately, it's no
wonder I can hardly catch a thing!"
42,Talk06,静かじゃのう…,It's so quiet...
43,Talk07,"なんじゃ…
せっかく寝てたというにのう",Could you not see I was sleeping?!
44,Talk08,"しっ…
静かにせい",Shhh... Quiet now...
45,Talk09,"木を切るなら よそでしてくれ…
獲物が逃げてしまうわ","Far be it from me to interfere with your
logging efforts...but could you do that
elsewhere? You're scaring off my prey."
46,Talk10,"静かにせんか…
獲物が逃げてしまうわ","As they say, silence is golden.
And my prey frightens easily..."
47,Talk11,"夜は魔物も増えて危ないぞ
朝まで ここで休んで行くがいい","It gets quite dangerous out here at night.
The land fills with unspeakable beasts.
Perhaps you should wait until morning..."
48,Talk14,祠のお宝は まだかの？,"How is your shrine treasure hunting
coming along?"
49,Talk15,祠の探索 はかどっておるかの？,How is the shrine exploration going?
50,TalkBokangi00,"なんじゃ…
せっかく寝てたというにのう","What is it now?! Can't you see I'm
trying to get some sleep?"
51,TalkBokangi01,寝てたというに しつこいのう…,"I can't tell if you're stubborn, oblivious,
or just plain rude! I was clearly sleeping!"
52,TerrorArrow,何をする！,What is this?!
53,TerrorBomb,何じゃ？,What is it?!
54,TerrorEnemy,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
55,TerrorExplosion,ぬわーっ！,Huh?!
