10,Clear1_00,"自信たっぷりじゃが
まだ 1つしか克服できとらんじゃないか","Your confidence is to be admired...
but you've only cleared one shrine."
11,Clear2_00,"良い返事じゃ
祠は 2つ克服できたようじゃのう","A spirited answer! Yes, it appears you
have cleared two shrines now."
12,Clear3_00,"自信たっぷりな返事をすると思うたら
祠を もう 3つも克服したとな？
じゃが…
残り1つが なかなか見つからないものよのう","You have cleared three shrines now.
Good work.

However...there is still one more that
eludes you, correct?"
13,FirstTalk00,"こんな老いぼれに後れを取るとは
お主も まだまだじゃのう","I'm surprised it took you so long to
catch up with an old man like me!"
14,FirstTalk01,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
年の功というやつじゃ",Oho ho! Leave an old man his secrets.
15,FirstTalk02,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ

ワープなど せんでも
お主に負けるような わしではないわ","Oho ho! So you think an old man like me
needs to fly to stay ahead of you?

I still have a few tricks left in me."
16,FirstTalk03,"遅い遅い待ちくたびれたぞ
もう一度 ワープの方法を教えてやろうか","Well, you certainly took your time.
Did you forget how to travel instantly?"
17,FirstTalk05,"シーカーストーンのマップを開いて
青い印のついた塔や祠を選ぶのじゃ
一度マップに登録された場所であれば
瞬時に移動できる… そう覚えておくがいい","Open the map on your Sheikah Slate,
and select one of the blue tower or
shrine icons.
If you've registered that location to the
map, you can travel there instantly."
18,FirstTalk06,"お主が祠を探している様子を
ここから ずっと見ておったぞ","I was observing you the entire time you
were searching for the shrines..."
19,FirstTalk07,"ものを探すには高いところから見回す のが一番
そう言ったじゃろう
ここは残りの祠を探す絶好のポイントじゃ","It's best to search for things from a
high vantage point. I doubt you need
a reminder of that, though.
Taking in the view here can teach you
much about shrine locations..."
20,FirstTalk08,"さてさて…

お主を ここに呼んだのは
ここが祠を探すのに絶好のポイントだからじゃ","Now then...


I wanted you to join me up here so you
could use this as a vantage point to
search for shrines."
21,FirstTalk09,"さてさて…
シーカーストーンの望遠鏡は使っておるか？
ここからは全ての祠が見える
祠を見つけたら ピンを打って目印にするのじゃ","Now then... Have you been using the
scope on your Sheikah Slate?

You can see all the shrines from up here.
When you find one, just stick a pin in it."
22,FirstTalk10,"お主シーカーストーンに
望遠鏡の機能があることは気づいておるか？
望遠鏡を覗いて祠を見つけたら
ピンを打って目印にすることができるのじゃ","Did you know about the scope
on your Sheikah Slate?

Look through it, and you can stick a pin
anywhere you'd like to mark on the map."
23,FirstTalk11,"ピンはマップでも打つことや消すことができる
お主の思うところに ピンを打ってみるがいい","The pins on your map serve as reference
points for your travels. Just stick a pin
anywhere you're interested in!"
24,FirstTalk12,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ

年の功… というやつじゃ
信じる信じないは お主の勝手じゃがな","Oho ho! 


Just a few tricks I've picked up
after many, many years in the wild...
You may take my advice or leave it."
25,FirstTalk13,"年の功… と言うたじゃろう
信じる信じないは お主の勝手じゃがな","Experience, wisdom...instinct?
Call it what you will and believe
it only if you so please."
26,FirstTalk14,さっそく ここから見回してみるがよかろう,"Go ahead and take a look if you feel
inclined to do so."
27,GoodBye01,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
パラセールが欲しかったら がんばることじゃ","Oho ho! If you still wish to acquire the
paraglider, you must put in the effort.
I will not simply give it away, you see."
28,GoodBye02,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
パラセールまで あと2つじゃ","Oho ho! Wonderful! Just two more until
you can have my paraglider."
29,GoodBye03,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
パラセールまで あと1つじゃ","Oho ho! Fantastic! Just one more until
you can have my paraglider."
30,Kotsu00,"コツで思い出したが…

新しく覚えた操作は
ポーズ画面で いつでも確認できるのじゃ","I just remembered something that may
help you.

You can review some of the abilities
you've learned on the pause screen."
31,Kotsu01,"祠を探すならシーカーストーンの
望遠鏡を使うといいじゃろう","If you're searching for shrines, use the
scope on your Sheikah Slate."
32,Kotsu02,"何度も言わせるでない
いざとなったら己だけが頼りじゃ
操作は ポーズ画面で確認するがいい","Must I keep repeating myself?
You really need to learn some
self-reliance, my friend.
Just check the pause screen if you ever
need a reminder of what you can do."
33,NakedPlayer,裸とな…,Aren't you...a bit chilly?

35,Near01,あと1つ…,One more...
36,Near02,あと2つ…,Two more...

39,Talk01,"のう お主…
いつまで そんな格好でおるつもりじゃ","So... How long were you planning on
going au naturel? Just curious."
40,Talk02,じきに日が沈むのう,The sun will set soon.
41,Talk03,夜の台地は静かじゃのう,The plateau is so quiet at night...
