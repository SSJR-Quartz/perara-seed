12,talk00,"こんにちは
ゾーラの宿サカナのねやへ ようこ…
…

……

あっ？！ リンリン？！
あなた リンリンよね！","Hello! Welcome to the Seabed Inn.
Here we—

...


...


Could it be? Linny?! It is! It's Linny!!"
13,talk01,こんにちは リンリン,"Hello, Linny!"
14,talk02,こんばんは リンリン,"Good evening, Linny!"
15,talk03,"うん間違いない！リンリンだ！
うわぁ久しぶりぃ～！
ミファー様と一緒に
厄災ガノンに倒されたんじゃないの？
じゃなかったら今までどこ行ってたの？
何してたの？ねぇねぇ？
…

あ ごめんなさい…
大人なのに はしゃいじゃって…
あれから 100年…
お互い いろいろあったと思うし
よかったら また話して？ね？","Yes, I'm sure of it! You're Linny!
Wow, it's been such a long time!

Wait, but...I thought you and Mipha...
fell to Calamity Ganon.

And if you've been alive all this time,
where have you been? What have you
been doing? Please, tell me!
...


Oh, I'm so sorry... I'm an adult, and yet
here I am, making a ruckus.

Has it really been 100 years?
In a way, it feels like yesterday...

We've both been through a lot, I'm sure.
If you don't mind, I'd love to catch up
sometime soon."
16,talk04,"えっ… リンリン…
ミファー様の事忘れちゃったの？","Huh?! Linny... You didn't forget about
Mipha, did you?"
17,talk05,はいはい～,Hello!
18,talk06,おはよう リンリン,"Good morning, Linny!"
19,talk07,私に御用？,Oh! Do you need something?
20,talk08,"ミファー様は ドレファン王のご息女…
シド王子の姉君にあたるのね
そして傷ついた者を癒す
ゾーラ族の英傑でもあったの
100年前厄災ガノンと戦うからって
神獣 ヴァ・ルッタに乗っていたんだけど
でもその後 どうなったのかは…ね？","Mipha was a princess. She was also
King Dorephan's daughter and
Sidon's older sister.
She was the Zora Champion and could
heal wounds with ease. We all loved
her dearly.
A hundred years ago, she piloted the
Divine Beast Vah Ruta to help fight
Calamity Ganon.
As for what happened next, well...
I'm sure you can figure it out."
21,talk09,うん じゃあね,OK. See you later.
22,talk10,"リンリン ひど～い
私は コダーよ！おぼえてるくせに！
100年前「私とミファー様どっちを取るの？」
って困らせたこと まだ根に持ってるの？
でも今では カーティと結婚して
一児の母だから安心してね
娘のフィネ共々 よろしくね！","You're terrible, Linny! It's me, Kodah!


A hundred years ago, I asked you...
to choose between me and Mipha.
I...I'm sorry about that.
Now I'm married to Kayden, and I'm a
mother of one. My daughter's name is
Finley. We're all very happy."
23,talk11,"それ 100年前に私が付けた あだ名よね！
可愛いでしょ？
あなたの本当の名はリンク…

あなたは ハイラルの英傑として
ミファー様と厄災ガノンに立ち向かった…
里のお年寄りは ハイリア人のあなたが
「ミファー様を奪ったゾラ」って ご立腹だけど
当時を知る今100歳そこそこのゾーラは
そうは思ってないの
あなたとミファー様は
大厄災を食い止めてくれた英傑よ！","Heh, that's the nickname I gave you
100 years ago! Isn't it the cutest?

Though much time has passed, I still
remember that your real name...
is Link.
And that you're the Hylian Champion!
You went with Mipha to fight back
against Calamity Ganon.
You should know that the council of
elders is angry about...what happened.
They say \""that Hylian\"" stole Mipha away.
But us Zora who are around 100 years
old now...we know what it was like back
then. We don't believe that.
You and Mipha are the Champions who
held back the Calamity for all of us!"
24,talk12,他に聞きたい事 ある？,Is there anything else you'd like to ask?
25,talk13,"雨が止んだ…
ルッタが動きを止めたのかしら…
あっ ごめんなさいリンリン","The rain has stopped... I wonder if Ruta
has stopped as well...

Oh! Sorry, Linny."
26,talk14,"あ！リンリン…
神獣を鎮めてくれたの？！","Linny! Were you able to appease the
Divine Beast?!"
27,talk15,"リンリン
神獣を鎮めてくれて ありがとう","Linny... Thank you for appeasing the
Divine Beast!"
28,talk16,"それにしても…
娘のフィネが ずっと見つからなくて…
自分だけの王子様を探すのよ
…なんて言い出して
またいつもの願いの川辺にでも
行ってるのかな？","That said... I can't find my daughter,
Finley. I've looked everywhere!

When last we spoke, she said something
crazy like, \""I want to find a prince of my
very own!\""
Hmm, I wonder if she's on her way to
the Bank of Wishes again..."
29,talk17,"それにしても
娘が連れてきた王子様って…
あなたと同じ ハイリア人なのに
なんだか頼りない感じ
あの男性選びの センスの無さ…
一体誰に似たのかな…","That said... The \""prince\"" my daughter
brought home...

He's a Hylian like you, heh. I don't think
he's quite what we expected, though.

Her horrible taste in men...it reminds me
of a certain someone."
30,talk18,"ウォーターベッドを使ってくれたんだね？
寝心地はどうだった？","You went for the water bed, right?
How did you sleep?"
31,talk19,"よかった～！

ハイリア人用に
ベッドをしつらえた甲斐が あったよ！","Oh! I'm so glad!


I knew it was worth the investment to
have a bed made especially for Hylians!"
32,talk20,"そっか～…
ちょっと冷たすぎたかな…","Oh. I see. Perhaps I cooled it down
too much..."
33,talk21,"こっちは調理場よ

ウチらゾーラ族は
生の魚を食べるんだけど
ハイリア人は料理した方が
元気モリモリなんだよね？
だからここ自由に使ってくれたらいいよ","This is the cooking area. We Zora mostly
eat raw fish, but...

Hylians get much more benefit out of
cooked food, right?

Yes, I thought so. Please feel free to use
this area as often as you wish."
34,talk22,流石 ハイラルの英傑様！,That's the Hylian Champion for you!
35,talk23,"まさかルッタを鎮めた人が 100年ぶりに現れた
リンリンだなんて…もうビックリよ！","I can't believe my dear Linny reappeared
after 100 years...and was also the one
to appease Ruta for us!
I really can't get over it!"
36,talk24,"ミファー様の事は残念だったけど…
一番悲しいのは リンリンよね…","It really was unfortunate about Mipha...
But I was saddest about you, Linny."
37,talk25,…ちょっと考え事してた,Wait...what was I going to say?
38,talk26,"毎日のご飯って悩むのよね
さてさて…","I can never decide what to make for
dinner. Anyhoo."
