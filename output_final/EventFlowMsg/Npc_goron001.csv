I take it? That's OK. First time for

A Goron-style massage is done on top of
a hard rock bed. Pressure is applied to
your body to squeeeeze the tension out.
But I'll tell ya, it doesn't hurt one bit.
Mostly. Honestly, I doze off sometimes!

When it's all over, you'll sleep like a
rock and feel great when ya wake up.
You'll be all limber and full of energy!"
