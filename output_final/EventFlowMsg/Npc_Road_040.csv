Actually I'm, like, totally wicked at it.

I just climb up the Hebra Mountains, and

あの人の滑りって惚れ惚れするんだよな","Riding a horse up a hill and then hopping

the Hebra Mountains. Her skills are even
sicker than mine!"

depending on the shield, your surfing
can be totally different?
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about shield surfing, man!
Get with it, dude!

supposed to be wicked for surfing. It's
called a kni— A knight's... Oh, man.

But, man, all I can think about is when
I'll be able to get back to the Hebra
Mountains to catch some of that powder.

Hebra Mountains on a map?

There's this totally gnarly crescent shape
that was apparently made by some
wicked beam forever ago.
