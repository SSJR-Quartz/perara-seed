ともかく俺は忙しいんだ邪魔しないでくれ","Huh... It's not every day you see topless
Hylians around these parts.

Anyway, I'm busy. Go away."
27,talk01,フン…,Hmph...
28,talk02,"でリンクさんよ

ウチの族長に会ってるって事は
俺を連れ戻しに来たんだろ？
全く…族長のお人好しにも参ったもんだ

どうせメドーにやられて怪我する前に
連れ帰って欲しいとか言われたんだろ
残念だが…
俺は ここを動くつもりは無いからな
俺だって リトの戦士の端くれ
仲間がやられて おめおめ帰る訳にはいかねぇさ
…しかしな""一つだけ
俺をリトの村に帰らせる方法があるぜ
それは神獣 ヴァ・メドーが沈黙し
ヤツが空から消えた時… つまり","Well, Link. I'm Teba.
But you already knew that.

I'm guessing the elder asked you to
come here and talk some sense into me.
Am I right?
Just like the elder to trust any fool wandering into
town.

Look—you seem like an all-right guy,
but let's make one thing clear:
I'm not going anywhere.
As a Rito warrior, I can't rest until my
people are safe.

There's only one way I'm going back to
Rito Village.

Once Divine Beast Vah Medoh falls from
the sky."
29,talk03,"神獣 ヴァ・メドーを ぶっ潰す…

それが今すぐ達成できりゃ
村に帰ってやってもいいぜ？","If I have to kill Medoh...so be it.


Only then will I return to the village."
30,talk05,"…何か用か？""俺は忙しいんだ","...Did you need something?
I'm busy here."
31,talk06,"手伝います？何を？

…待て

神獣 ヴァ・メドーを知る客人か…
さては族長や妻の仕業だな？
だとしたら俺の事も聞いているだろう？
俺が テバだ
客人の名を聞いておこうか

フム…リンク…
どこかで聞いたような名だな","Help me? With what exactly?


Let me get this straight...


Some random Hylian wants to help me
bring down Divine Beast Vah Medoh?
I'm not buying it.
What's your name, stranger?


Link, huh?"
32,talk07,"分かってます？

ハハッ！
俺の性格まで村のヤツらに教えられたか！
…でもな族長が言ってたぜ

神獣 ヴァ・メドーを本当に止めるには
ヤツの内部に入らないと ダメだってな
まさか おまえ…
メドーの中に入れるとか？","Are you serious?


HA! Well, far be it from me to talk you
off the ledge.

But it's as the elder said: the only way
to stop Divine Beast Vah Medoh is to
get inside it.
Fat chance of that happening. There's no
way we can set foot in Medoh."
33,talk08,"じゃ行け
矢で的を5個だぞ","Then go destroy five targets with your
arrows."
34,talk09,"フン…""臆したか","Hmph... Cold feet, huh?"
35,talk10,"すまなかった リンク…
俺はおまえを勘違いしていたようだ
あの弓捌き
かなりの修羅場を くぐって来たんだろ？","I've got to tell you, Link...
When you first showed up, I thought
someone was pulling a prank on me.
But after seeing you handle that bow,
I can tell you're the real deal. You must
have seen a battle or two."
36,talk11,"おいおい… そうは言うものの
バクダン矢を持ってないじゃないか
メドーに挑むなら 
10本以上は用意した方がいいと思うぜ","It's great that you've made your peace,
but you don't have any bomb arrows.

To face off against Medoh, you're going
to need at least 10 bomb arrows...
probably more."
37,talk12,"おいおい… そうは言うものの
矢が足りないんじゃないか？
単純計算で的を５コ壊すなら
矢は５本は必要だろ？","Oh, geez. You think you're ready?
You don't even have enough arrows!

Simple math says you need at least five
arrows to hit five targets, right?
We're so doomed."
38,talk14,"どうしたリンクさんとやら
おまえの腕前を見せてもらおうか","Link, was it? Why don't you show me
what you're made of?"
39,talk15,"場外だ！""一旦戻って来い！",Out of bounds! Back to the start!
40,talk16,どうした？ もう やめるのか？,What? Quitting already?
41,talk17,フン… その程度か…,Figures...
42,talk18,よし OKだ！戻って来い！,OK! Come on back!
43,talk19,"矢が無くなったか？
一旦戻って来い！","Out of arrows?
Come on back!"

一旦戻って来い！","You ran out of BOWS?!
Pshhh... Come on back."
45,talk22,"ハハッ！メドーに到達するための翼も無い上に
無知ときたか！
じゃあ教えてやろう

神獣の中に入れるのは 100年前に実在した
英傑と呼ばれる 5人だけだ
そして その英傑様は全員
その当時に亡くなっている
ガノンの手によってな

…まぁいい

とにかくメドーに入れようが入れまいが
ヤツを黙らせる事ができれば それでいい
ただな…無暗にメドーに近づくと
ヤツの砲台の餌食になるだけだぜ
なので試させてもらう","So not only are you wingless...you're
brainless too.

Let me fill you in—the only people able
to enter the Divine Beasts are the five
Champions of old.
And unfortunately for us and the rest of
Hyrule, they all died a hundred years
ago.
If it hadn't been for Ganon...


Never mind. Let's focus on bringing
down Medoh...one step at a time.

If we approach Medoh recklessly, its
cannons will blast us out of the sky
before we even get close.
...So I'm going to need to test you
before I take you with me."
46,talk23,分かってんなら行きな,Bye.
47,talk24,"メドーの砲台を ぶっ壊すための
バクダン矢を忘れるな
それと上空はここよりも寒い
寒さ対策も忘れるなよ
リトの村ならバクダン矢も
耐寒用の装備も売っている
耐寒装備が無けりゃ そこの鍋で
温かい料理でも作って持って行く事だな","Don't forget bomb arrows. You'll need
them to destroy Medoh's cannons.

Also, it's cold up there. You'll need
something to keep warm.

If you haven't already, think about
some warm clothes from Rito Village.

Or cook something to keep yourself warm
using that pot over there. Your call."
48,talk25,じゃあ おまえの腕前見せてもらおうか,Are you ready to be tested?
49,talk26,"フン… それじゃあ神獣 ヴァ・メドーは潰せねぇ
挑戦したくなったら また来るがいい","Hmph... Shouldn't have gotten my hopes
up. Come back once you're serious about
bringing down Divine Beast Vah Medoh."
50,talk27,時間切れだ！戻って来い！,Time's up. Come on back.
51,talk28,"…その勢いは認めてやるが
弓を持ってないじゃないか
弓くらいは自分で調達して来るんだな","...I appreciate your enthusiasm, but 
enthusiasm can't shoot arrows.
Come back once you find yourself a bow."
52,talk29,"バクダン矢ならリトの村でも売ってるはずだ

買うのがイヤなら どっかで拾って来るこったな","If you need bomb arrows, they sell them
in Rito Village. Or if you're on a budget,
you could find some lying around."
53,talk32,"いよいよ神獣 ヴァ・メドーを止めに行く

砲台は普通の矢じゃ歯が立たねぇ
だからバクダン矢で ぶっ壊すんだ","OK, it's time to face
Divine Beast Vah Medoh.

Normal arrows won't put a dent in those
cannons. You'll need to hit them with
bomb arrows."
54,talk33,"メドーの攻撃は俺が引き付ける
その間に おまえはヤツの砲台を壊すんだ
砲台は合計４つ
本体はバリアで包まれてるから狙うだけ無駄だ
とりあえず砲台を全部ぶっ壊してくれ
話はそれからだ","I'll draw Medoh's fire. That'll be your
chance to destroy its cannons.

There are four cannons total.
The main body is protected by a barrier,
so there's no use attacking it.
Just focus on taking out all the cannons.
We'll talk next steps once that's done."
55,talk35,"…おいおい弓を持ってないじゃないか
待っててやるから早く調達して来いよ","Hold it. You don't have a bow.
Hurry up and find one."
56,talk38,"さぁ神獣 ヴァ・メドーを止めに行くぜ
寒さ対策とバクダン矢の準備はいいか？？","OK. It's time to face
Divine Beast Vah Medoh.

Can you handle the cold up there?
Do you have enough bomb arrows?"
57,talk40,"弓が無くなったのか？！
一旦引き返すぞ！","You ran out of bows?!
Urgh... We'll have to retreat for now."
58,talk41,"バクダン矢が無くなったのか？！
一旦引き返すぞ！","You're out of bomb arrows?!
RETREAT!"
59,talk42,"神獣 ヴァ・メドー…
ただデカいだけじゃなさそうだ
準備が整ったら また声をかけてくれ","We'll have to worry about more than just
Divine Beast Vah Medoh's size.

Talk to me again when you're ready."
60,talk43,"フン… その格好はともかく
弓の腕は確かなようだな","Hmm... I'm not sure about your fashion
sense, but you're certainly a fine archer."
61,talk44,"リンクか…""気に入ったぜ

今度はこっちが お願いする番だ
俺に ついて来てくれ
そしてメドーへ…
ヤツの砲台へ渾身の一撃を ブっ放してくれ
…そうだ そこの宝箱に
俺が調整した弓が入っている持って行きな
準備ができたら声をかけてくれ","Link... I feel I've heard the name
somewhere before...

Well, if you really want to help me bring
down Medoh, it's now or never.

I'll get you into position so you can give
its cannons all you've got.

Inside that treasure chest is a bow I've
modified. Take it, and let me know when
you're ready."
62,talk46,さぁ準備ができたら行くぞ,We can go whenever you're ready.
63,talk47,だろうな…,I believe it.
64,talk48,謙遜するな見りゃ分かるさ,"Don't be modest. I can tell just looking
at you."
65,talk49,"おまえ…相当な弓使いだな
矢を放つ瞬間時間が止まっているようだったぜ","You're...a skilled archer. It was as if time
stopped with every arrow you let fly."
66,talk50,"ほぅ… なかなかやるじゃないか
ただのハイリア人ではなさそうだな",Hmm... Not bad at all...for a Hylian. 
67,talk51,手こずったようだが なかなかの腕だ,"A bit iffy at times, but you did well
enough."
68,talk56,フム…,Hmph...
69,talk60,"よし…

だが その前に一つ俺から質問させてくれ

リンク…おまえは なぜそこまでして
メドー討伐に協力してくれるんだ？","All right. But let me ask you something.


Why are you doing this?
Why risk your life to bring down Medoh?"
70,talk61,まぁいい…,That's fair enough...
71,talk62,"…フン これは俺一人の問題だ
部外者にゃ関係ねぇ","Hmph... This is a Rito problem.
It's not your concern."
72,talk63,"俺達リトの戦士は この谷の上昇気流を利用して
空中戦を想定した弓矢の訓練をする

どこまでできるか見せてもらおう

的を5個""3分以内に壊してみろ","We Rito warriors use the updraft in this
ravine to hone our aerial archery skills.

The updrafts are so strong here that a
person could just open up a cloth over
their head and float up easily.
Now let's see what you're capable of.


You'll have to maneuver through the
air and destroy five of the targets set up
in this valley in three minutes."
73,talk64,"弓の使い方は空中でも同じだ

当然弓も長距離を狙える物の方が
いいだろうな
矢で3分以内に的を5個壊す…
これくらいできないとメドーには対抗できない","Using a bow in midair is just like using a
bow on the ground.

But you'll probably want a bow suited
for long-range engagement.

Use your arrows to destroy five targets
in three minutes. If you can't do that,
you don't stand a chance against Medoh."
74,talk65,"おまえか…
俺とした事が情けねぇ","You...
I can't believe it got me..."
75,talk66,"すまねぇが脚が動かねぇんだ
よりによって こんな時に…","I can't move my leg.
And at a time like this...
Sorry."
76,talk67,"脚は動かねぇしバクダン矢も尽きた
万事休すか…","Can't move my leg, and I'm all out of
bomb arrows. There's nothing more I
can do..."
77,talk68,"すまねぇが俺はここで治療に専念する

このまま黙って村に帰るワケには
いかねぇだろ…","Sorry, but I'm going to stay here
and heal up a bit.

I can't go back to the village like this..."
78,talk70,"脚の傷は思ったより深そうだ

もう少しで神獣 ヴァ・メドーを

But that's the name of the princess 
Revali served 100 years ago at 
Hyrule Castle.

Medoh, your motivation is fine by me."

「やーめた」は無しだぜ","Rito Village? It's not like you'll get
the keys to the village, you know.

mind once you get up there and see
