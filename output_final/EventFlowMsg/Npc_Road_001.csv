用心棒がくたばるわけにはいかねえぜ","So it's to be violence, then. Very well.

We don't stand a chance against the
likes of that thing!"
50,MSG_Bado_00,"…この俺が？何をしてるのかって？
怪しい奴がいないか見回りをしてるところだ！
ここはハイラル平原の南西だ
魔物の多い地帯だから気をつけろって話だ！","...Who, me? What am I doing, you ask?
I'm on patrol, keeping the watch!
I am a watchman!
This southwest corner of Hyrule Field is
awash in monsters and suspicious types, 
so you've got to tread carefully!"
51,MSG_Bado_00_1,"怪しい奴がいないか見回りをしてるところだ！
魔物の多い地帯だから気をつけろよ！","I'm on patrol, keeping the watch!
Monsters abound, so watch yourself!"
52,MSG_Bado_01,"昔々 この辺りに闘技場があったが
今では魔物がすみつく廃墟と化しているんだ！
まあ ある意味
今でも人と魔物との闘技場ってわけだ！","A long time ago, there used to be an
arena for combat nearby, but it's fallen
to ruin and is a home for foul monsters.
I suppose you could say it still IS an
arena for combat, but more the life-or-
death-against-monsters variety."
53,MSG_Bado_01_1,"昔々 この辺りにあった闘技場は
今では魔物がすみつく廃墟と化しているんだ！","A long time ago, there used to be an
arena for combat nearby, but it's fallen
to ruin and is a home for foul monsters."
54,MSG_Bado_02,"なあ あんた…
「ヌシ」ってのを知ってるか？
ここから北西のサトリ山に出やがるらしいが…
そもそも「ヌシ」ってのは何なんだ？","Say... Have you heard tell of the
Lord of the Mountain?

They say he appears on Satori Mountain,
northwest of here...but what is he?
The Lord of the Mountain..."
55,MSG_Bado_02_1,"「ヌシ」ってのを知ってるか？
ここから北西のサトリ山に出やがるらしいぜ","Have you heard of the Lord of the
Mountain? It's said that he appears on 
Satori Mountain, northwest of here."
56,MSG_Bado_03,"馬宿の北方面は比較的安全と言われるが
だからといって見回りは怠らないぜ！","They say the north side of the stable is
relatively safe, but even so, I won't shirk
my patrol duties! I am a watchman!"
57,MSG_Bado_03_1,"安全と言われていようが見回りは怠らない
それが用心棒ってもんだぜ！","They say it's relatively safe, but I won't
shirk my patrol duties! I always watch!
That's what it means to be a watchman!"
58,MSG_Bado_04,"この先 ハイラル丘陵の手前にあるサトリ山には
「ヌシ」っていうのがいると聞く…
あの辺には普段動物がほとんどいないんだが…
「ヌシ」が現れると動物が集まってくるらしい
だけど その「ヌシ」ってのは
そもそも何なんだよ？！","The Lord of the Mountain is said to
make Satori Mountain its home... 
That's just ahead, before Hyrule Ridge.
Animals rarely appear there, but...they
say if this lord appears, the animals will
heed its call and gather.
But just what in the world could it be?
What is this lord creature?!"
59,MSG_Bado_04_1,"この先にある サトリ山辺りには
普段動物がほとんどいないんだが…
「ヌシ」が現れると動物が集まってくるらしい","Normally, few animals make their home
around Satori Mountain, just ahead...

But they say an appearance by the
Lord of the Mountain calls to the souls
of the animals and makes them gather."
60,Near00,さあ見回り見回り…,"Now, back to my patrol..."
61,Near01,旅人の安全を…,A watchman watches...
62,Near02,じき日が暮れるな…,Sunset pretty soon...
63,Near03,夜の見回り…,"Ugh, night patrol..."
64,Near04,降ってきやがった！,RAIN!
65,Rest_00,"あんた もしかして俺と同じ用心棒か？
旅人にしては俺と同じ匂いを感じるんだよな","You're not a watchman like me, are you?
Yet I fear we both have the stink of long
travel upon us. We are fragrant."
66,Rest_01,"雨は視界を遮り集中力を奪う
慣れない土地をふらつくのは危険だぜ！","Rain obstructs one's view and steals
one's concentration. If you aren't familiar
with the area, it's dangerous to wander!"
67,Rest_02,"雨は視界を遮り集中力を奪う
あんたも ここで雨宿りしていったらどうだ？","Rain obstructs one's view and steals
one's concentration. Why don't you take
shelter from the rain here, too?"
68,RetMSG_Bado_00,"おい一人歩きは危ないぞ！
砂漠方面には手強い魔物がたくさんいる
それでも行くというのなら武器を揃えて
自分の身は自分で守ることだな","Hey, it's dangerous to travel alone!
Monsters of great strength haunt the
way to the desert.
If you insist on going, make sure you
have proper weapons equipped so you
can protect yourself."
69,RetMSG_Bado_00_1,"砂漠方面には手強い魔物がたくさんいるぞ
行くのなら自分の身は自分で守ることだな","Monsters of great strength lie in wait on
the road to the desert. If you insist on
going, you'll have to protect yourself."
70,RetMSG_Bado_01,"ここからすぐ東の岩山の裏に
古代の闘技場跡地があるんだが…
今じゃ魔物が巣食う恐ろしい廃墟だ
武器をあさる盗賊以外は近づきやしない","On the other side of those rocky
mountains to the east are the ancient
Coliseum Ruins...
It's a fell place, teeming with monsters.
Only scavengers hunting for weapons
dare to go near the ruins."
71,RetMSG_Bado_01_1,"東の岩山の裏にある古代の闘技場跡地は
今じゃ魔物が巣食う恐ろしい廃墟だぜ","The ancient Coliseum Ruins on the
other side of those rocky mountains to
the east are alive with fell monsters."
72,RetMSG_Bado_02,"馬宿前の崖からハイラル城の跡が見えるだろ？
そこには伝説級の武器が眠るという話だ
それも ひとつやふたつじゃないらしいが…
いいか？危険だから絶対にやめておけよ！","You can see the remains of Hyrule Castle
from the cliff in front of the stable, right?
They say legendary weapons sleep there.
And not just one or two, either...
But do not be tempted! It's far too
dangerous to approach, so stay away!"
73,RetMSG_Bado_02_1,"ハイラル城の跡に伝説級の武器が眠るというが
危険だから絶対に取りに行くんじゃないぞ！","They say legendary weapons sleep in the
remains of Hyrule Castle, but it's far too
dangerous, so don't be tempted!"
74,RetMSG_Bado_03,"地震とともに塔が現れた頃から
魔物の数も増えてきてると思わないか？
旅を続けたいなら武器や装備を揃えて
自分の身は自分で守ることだな！","Ever since that earthquake when the
towers appeared, doesn't it seem like
monsters roam in greater numbers?
If you want to keep traveling, you'd do
well to load up on weapons and gear so
you can defend yourself!"
75,RetMSG_Bado_03_1,"旅を続けたいなら武器や装備を揃えて
自分の身は自分で守ることだな！","If you want to keep traveling, you'd best
prepare weapons and equipment so
you can defend yourself!"
76,RetMSG_Bado_04,"あんたリトの村に行きたいんだろ？
だったら道なりに北！タバンタ辺境をめざせ！
ただし ガーディアンに会いたくなかったら
東から迂回した方が利口かもな！","You want to go to Rito Village, right?
Then just follow the road north.
Head for the Tabantha Frontier!
But...if you don't want to run into any
Guardians, it may be wiser to take a
detour to the east!"
77,RetMSG_Bado_04_1,"リトの村に行きたいんなら道なりに北！
タバンタ辺境を通った方が近いぜ
ただし あの辺には ガーディアンがいるから
東から迂回した方が利口かもな！","If you want to go to Rito Village, follow
the road north. Cutting through the
Tabantha Frontier is the fastest route.
But there are a bunch of Guardians in
that area, so it may be wiser to take a
detour to the east!"
78,SavedLv1_00,"そこそこ やるじゃないか
腕利き用心棒の俺ほどではないにしても","You handle yourself rather well.
You're not quite as adept as a seasoned
watchman like me, but really, who is?"
79,SavedLv1_01,"様子を見させてもらったが
そこそこ やるじゃないか","I was just taking an observer role to see
how the situation would play out, but
you seem to have handled it fairly well."
80,SavedLv2_00,"た…助けてもらったことは内緒で頼む
なにしろ俺 これでも用心棒なんで…","Let's... Let's just keep this \""rescue\""
between us, shall we? Yes, let's do.
I am a watchman, after all..."
81,SavedLv2_01,"ま…魔物に恐れをなしたわけじゃないぞ
なにしろ俺 これでも用心棒なんで…","It's... It's not as though I've started
fearing monsters or anything like that.
I am a watchman!"
82,SavedLv3_00,"つ…つまり…命あっての用心棒だ！
今回はあれだったが次は俺が助けてやる！","Inexplicable... Though I nearly fell, I am
a watchman! And though you saved me
today, I shall save you tomorrow! Maybe."
83,SavedLv3_01,"お…俺は用心棒だが
用心棒にも用心棒が必要かもしれん…","I... I am a watchman! But...perhaps even
watchmen need watchers to watch over
them now and then..."
84,Talk01,"…ところで話は変わるが
最近は冒険のための装備を売って歩いてる
用心棒だけじゃ食っていけなくてね…","Say, on an entirely different topic...
I've recently begun selling adventuring
gear as I travel.
Doing work as a watchman certainly
fills my soul, but not my pockets..."
85,Talk01_1,"何事も用心するに越したことはない
冒険のための装備なら まかせてくれ！","You can really never be too prepared.
If you need proper gear for adventuring, 
you've come to the right fellow!"
86,Talk02,準備は万端か？,Need anything else?
87,Thanks00,"まあ…""礼ぐらいは しておこうか","Well... I guess a token of my gratitude
would be appropriate."
