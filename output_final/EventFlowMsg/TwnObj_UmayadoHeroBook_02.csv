7,Book00,"ダルケルの日記""を読みますか？",Read Daruk's Training Journal?
8,Book01,"今日から ニッキ というものをつける事にした
その日の事を忘れねえうちに書けばいいそうだ
まあゴロン族は毎日代り映えしねえ生活だ
ちっとの違いでも書いとく事は悪くねえだろう
という訳で今日のニッキは… そうだな
デスマウンテン山頂のロース岩が美味かった！","I'm gonna start writin' in this \""diary\""
thing startin'...now. Ugh, a diary...
Maybe I'll call it my training journal.
They say all ya gotta do is write down
stuff that happens. Us Gorons prefer the
simple life, so I hope simple stuff counts.
Let's see. For today's journal entry,
what should I write about?

Oh, I know! I had some rock roast from
the peak of Death Mountain. It was
delicious! I think I'll eat more of it soon."
9,Book02,"山の麓で旅のハイリア人と話をした
今ハイラルは厄災ガノンの噂で持ち切りらしい
そういえば数年前神獣とやらが掘り出されて
デスマウンテンに シーカー族が押しかけてたな
ハイリア人の話じゃ あれは厄災ガノンと
戦う道具で繰り手が必要になるって事らしい
あの頃…喰えもしねえ遺物なんぞ
ゴロン族は誰一人見向きもしなかったもんだが
喰いもんの事考えてたら腹減って来たな…
今日の晩飯は上ロース岩にするか！","I talked to some Hylians at the base of
the mountain. All anyone wants to talk
about these days is Calamity Ganon.
Reminds me of when those tiny Sheikah
came to Death Mountain a few years ago
to dig up that Divine Beast or whatever.
The Hylians were sayin' that beast thing
is a weapon someone will need to
learn how to control.
Back in the good ol' days, Gorons didn't
worry about relics we couldn't eat.
Mmm... Now I'm hungry.
Maybe I'll track down a prime rock roast
for one of my dinners tonight!"
10,Book03,"今日山頂近くで昼飯用の岩を探してると
山腹で魔物共に襲われてる人間が見えた
ひ弱そうな見た目の小僧だったから 
助けてやるかと山を下りた
ところがどうだ そいつは凄え剣の腕前だった！
俺が着いた時魔物は粗方片づけられた後！
こいつは強えと感心してたその時…不意に
背後から魔物が俺様に斬りかかってきやがった！
…まさか このダルケル様が ハイリア人の
小僧に助けられるとは思ってもみなかったぜ
あいつの剣捌きに見とれてたときの俺は
すげえマヌケ面をしてたんだろうな…","Today I saw someone bein' attacked
when I was out lookin' for lunch rocks
at the peak.
He was a little tiny guy, so I rushed down
the mountain to help him. I was shocked
to find he was handy with a sword!
By the time I rolled his way, he'd already
taken out all the monsters! I couldn't
help but admire his Goron-like strength.
While I was distracted, a monster almost
got the jump on me. He stopped it.
The Great Daruk...saved by a tiny Hylian.
I must have had a dopey look on
my face when that happened.
Hope he didn't notice."
11,Book04,"ハイリア人の小僧の名前は リンク
奴は喰うのが何よりも好きだ
野菜果物生き物…それ喰えんのかってモンまで
リンクは何でも料理して喰う
それならと特上ロース岩を譲ってやった
後で訊いてみたら ちゃんと喰ったそうだ
やっぱり人間も岩を喰えるんだな

このダルケル様と奴の共通点は
喰うことだけじゃない… とにかく すげぇ強え
奴が言うには集中すると
時間が止まったようになるらしい 
俺は奴を気に入った…

このダルケル様が背中を預け
共に飯を喰らうに相応しい男だ
よし！ リンクを俺の相棒にしよう！","That little Hylian from before is named
Link. He's got a respectable appetite.
Loves to eat meat, fruit, vegetables...
all sorts of things a decent person
wouldn't dream of eating.

Link will cook up and eat just about
anything. I offered him some Grade A
rock roast to help refine his palette.
I asked him how it tasted. He liked it
so much, he was speechless.

I knew Hylians could eat rocks too.


Eating isn't the only thing Link and I
have in common. The little guy is also
incredibly strong!
He said sometimes when he focuses,
it feels like time slows down. Heh!
I really like that guy.
He's the type of guy you can trust to
have your back and also have a nice
hearty meal with.
Yeah! That settles it! From now on,
Link is an official brother."
12,Book05,"ハイラル王国の姫さんが ゴロンシティに来て
神獣の繰り手を頼んできたので引き受けた
ダルケル様は頼られたら断らねえのが身上だ
姫さんも喜んでた
神獣の繰り手は4人… ガノンとやりあう
剣士が1人… それと姫さんの6人が仲間だ
話によると種族も歳もバラバラだが… 
今から そいつらと飯を喰うのが楽しみだな
まずは姫さんに特上リブロース岩を渡したら
喜んで受け取ってくれた
なんか笑顔がひきつってたみてえだったが…","Hyrule's little princess came to
Goron City and asked me to pilot
the Divine Beast. I said yes.
The Great Daruk never turns down
someone in need! When I said I would,
the princess seemed really happy.
There will be four Champions to control
four Divine Beasts, and one swordsman
to take on Ganon.
Including the princess, our anti-Ganon
team is six strong, made up of all
different kinds of people.
This has the makings of an epic feast.
I got the ball rollin' by giving the
princess my best rock roast.
She said thanks, but...I think she was
holdin' back a grimace. Must have had
somethin' foul on her mind."
13,Book06,"俺は英傑になった 

叙任式でリンクにも久し振りに会えたし
いい日だったな
そういや前に聞いてた姫さん御付の騎士は
リンクで決まりだそうだ
なんでも試験中に古代のカラクリ兵が暴走して
ビームを撃ちまくったそうで…
それを相棒が落ちてたナベのフタで跳ね返し
急所に命中させて暴走を止めたんだと
その活躍が王の目に留まっての大抜擢！
さすが俺の相棒だ","I'm a Champion now. Feels good.


I hadn't talked with Link in a while,
so seeing him at the inauguration
ceremony was nice. It was a good day.
Oh, word has it Link has been chosen as
Zelda's appointed knight. I can't think
of a better brother for the job.
I hear one of those ancient machine
things went nuts during some test
and shot out deadly beams!
With true Goron spirit, Link grabbed a
pot lid from the ground and deflected
the blast.
He nailed the thing in its weak spot
and saved the day.

His bravery caught the king's eye,
and not long after that, he was
appointed to guard Zelda!
I'd expect nothin' less from the
little guy!"
14,Book07,"ルーダニアの繰り手に決まったが
他の3人みたいに上手く神獣を繰れねえ
リンクに相談をしてみたら神獣に押し込まれ
ただひたすら一日中歩かされた
するとどうだ気づけばルーダニアは
俺の思い通りに動くじゃねえか
なるほど習うより慣れろだ
相棒の強さは こういう努力の賜物なんだな
今日のお礼に極上サーロイン岩を
御馳走してやろう","I've been chosen to pilot Rudania, but I
was havin' trouble controlling it. I was
the only Champion who was struggling.
I asked Link for advice, but he just
shoved me into the Divine Beast so
I could explore it aimlessly all day.
I can't explain it, but by the end of
the day, I was able to control Rudania
just how I wanted to!
I guess experience is the best teacher.
Little guy's strength must come from
workin' hard and never givin' up.
Good lesson, brother! As thanks,
I'm gonna treat him to some gourmet
sirloin rock."
15,Book08,"最近相棒は ずっと姫さんの遺物研究のお供だ

大変そうだが姫さんは明るくなったし
よく話すようになったみてえだから まあいいか
何でも一度姫さんと飯を喰ってるときに
相棒は自分の悩みを話したそうだ
それを聞いて「私と同じなんですね…」
と姫さんは言ったらしいが…
きっとあの二人は喰いモンの好き嫌いが
同じってことなんだろうな
ところで最近分かってきたことがある…

ニッキを書くと腹が減る！","All my Hylian brother seems to do these
days is watch over the tiny princess
while she does her research.
It looks like tough work, but the princess
seems a lot happier and talks more since
she's been doin' it, so it must be OK.
I hear the little guy finally opened up
about his troubles to the princess
while they were shovelin' food.
Surprisingly, she opened up right back.
Said somethin' princessy like, \""I guess
we're the same, you and I.\""
Hmm... Sounds heavy. They must
have been bondin' over their food
preferences. That'll do it, all right.
Speakin' of openin' up, all this journal
writin' has made me realize somethin'
about myself...
Writing makes me hungry."
