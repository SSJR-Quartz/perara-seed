これでも食って剣士様のようにならんとな！","You see, the thing about that
swordsman is...

He trained with swift carrots
instead of a blade!

He strengthened his body with a diet
made entirely of swift carrots!

And he tempered his soul with the sweet
aroma of swift carrots too!

That's what my grandfather always used
to say, anyway...

So I suggest you stop joking around all
the time and instead...have a carrot and
try to be more like the swordsman!"
20,FirstTalk03,"まあ素材屋に行けばニンジンはたんとある
もっと欲しいなら後は自分で買うんじゃな","Welp, you'll find carrots over at the

獲物をしとめる前に日が暮れる始末じゃ！
攻撃こそが最大の防御じゃというに…","The old man fiddling about in the field
beyond the stream... That's who I'm
talkin' about.
The two of us have been at odds
for ages.

That jokester goes on and on about
the best offense being a good defense.
That doesn't even make any sense!
Even when we go out hunting,
he takes forever to quietly
creep up on our prey...
until even the sun gets bored and sets
before he catches anything!

I always tell him that the best defense
is a good offense. The poor fool won't
listen to reason."

ground just by swinging your sword
while you're jumping.
The higher up you are, the more damage
you'll do. However...

If you're TOO high up, you'll be the one
who takes damage.

Once you get the hang of this, it's quite
useful for surprise attacks on groups of
enemies down below you."

HYAH! They're met with the taste
of steel! Or wood, depending on your
weapon of choice.
