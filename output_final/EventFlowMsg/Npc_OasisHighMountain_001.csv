3,talk00,"う～ん…

ケモノ肉しかないのかぁ…

あ～あ
チキンが食べたかったのになぁ…","Hrm...


Do they really not have any poultry?


*sigh*
I wanted poultry..."
4,talk04,"リト族って…夜はほとんど何も
見えなくなっちゃうんだけど
夜でも ここの街は明るいから
お肉のサシまで見えて ちょっと感激だよ
リトの村も もっと明るくなったら
夜でも お出かけできるのになぁ…","Us Rito... We haven't got the best
night vision, to be honest.

But this town is always so lit up, I can
even see the marbling of the meat.
It makes me a little emotional.
If Rito Village were brighter, we'd
be able to go out at night, too..."
5,talk05,"見たところ…
リト族って私しかいないみたいだけど…
ここでは リト族は珍しいのかな…","I haven't seen any other Rito around
here... Could I be the only one that's
traveled to this town?"
6,talk06,"どのお肉にしようか考えてたら
売り切れちゃったんだ…
チキンにこだわらず
さっさと買っておけばよかったかなぁ…","I may have spent too much time trying
to decide what to get instead of poultry.

Last time I was so choosy, they sold out
of everything before I bought anything!"
7,talk07,"リト族って…夜はほとんど何も
見えなくなっちゃうんだけど
夜でも ここの街は明るいから

8,talk08,"おはよう！

本当は

「サヴォッタ！」

ってカッコよく言いたいところなんだけど
まだちょっと恥ずかしくてね…","Good morning!


I really want to use the actual Gerudo
greeting.

You know...Sav'otta!


But I'm worried I'd mess it up and
embarrass myself..."
9,talk09,"こんにちは！

本当は

「サヴァーク！」

って言いたいところなんだけど

embarrass myself..."
10,talk10,"こんばんは！

本当は

「サヴァサーバ！」

って言いたいところなんだけど
まだちょっと恥ずかしくてね…","Evening!


I really want to use the actual Gerudo

You know... Sav'saaba...

embarrass myself..."
11,talk11,"ここのお肉
すっごいイイにおいなんだ
ニオイだけでも
ごはん3杯はいけちゃうかも
でもこれがチキンだったら…

5杯は行けるかも…","The meat they offer here smells so good.
I won't be able to limit myself to less
than...three helpings at dinner!
Oh, but if it was poultry...and cooked
as well as this is...I don't know how
I'd ever stop!"
12,talk12,"ここのお肉…
あなたも狙ってるの？
ワイルドな見た目とか
野性味あふれるニオイとか…
一晩中眺めてられるわ…

って思ってたら朝になっちゃった

これがチキンだったら…
一生眺めてられるかも","Are you eyeing the meat selection, too?
It just smells so good and looks so
tasty... I could stare at it all night long.
Oh. It's morning now? I guess I did
actually stare at it all night...

But if it was poultry sitting here, ready
to be eaten... I could stare at it all
my life!"
13,talk13,"お肉なくなっちゃったけど…

ニオイはまだ残ってるから
これだけでも ごはん2杯はいけちゃうかも
でもこれがチキンだったら…

4杯は行けるかも…","The meat is all gone, but the wonderful
smell remains...

Even the smell makes me so hungry.
I'm sure I'll want at least two servings
when I eat next.
And if this smell was from poultry...
It'd be four servings, at least!"
14,talk14,"ケモノ肉 なくなっちゃったけど
私の一番のお目当ては チキンだからさ
もし チキンが入ったら
私が全部買い占めるんだから！","The meat usually goes fast, but that's
fine—I had my heart set on poultry!
When they get poultry, I'll buy it all!"
15,talk15,"何て言うか…
ほら…
私外国語できますよ…って
アピールしてるみたいでさ…","You know, like...


\""Look at me! I can speak another
language!\"" It just feels like bragging."
16,talk16,"やっぱ考えすぎかな…

私が住んでるリトの村は
あんまり観光客とか来ないし
ゲルドの街みたいな
オープンな街の感覚がちょっとわからなくてさ…
でもせっかく来たし楽しまないとって思って
大好きなお肉食べに来たんだけど…
ここケモノ肉しかないんだよね…","You really think I'm putting too much
thought into it? Maybe you're right.

Gerudo Town is so different from home...


I live in Rito Village. We don't get many
visitors there, so I'm not really familiar
with non-Rito...
But now that I'm here, I should enjoy 
myself! I wanted to start by trying out
some of the meat here, but...
Well, they don't seem to have poultry."
17,talk17,"あなたの村も
観光客あまり来ないとこ？
