7,Talk_01,"族長様は幼いながらも
民のことを一番に想っておられる優しいお方
こんな大変な時でも
訪問者は通せとおっしゃっているが…
いいか！中に入ることは許可するが
族長様の邪魔だけはするんじゃないぞ！","The chief may be young, but she's a
kind person who puts her people first.

She told me to allow visitors through,
even in these tough times...

Hey, listen! Even though I'm letting you
inside, that doesn't mean you can go
getting in the chief's way! Watch out!"
8,Talk_02,"それにしても このメルエナというヴァーイ…
モルドラジークの肝を探してるみたいだが…
モルドラジークの住処は極暑地帯で
ただでさえ誰も行きたがらないのに
さらに あの怪物を倒して
肝を手に入れるなんて…
可哀相だが少なくともこの街には
このヴァーイを助けられる者は おらんだろうな","That being said, this vai called
Malena... It seemed she was looking
for Molduga guts.
Molduga live in extremely hot areas.


No one wants to go there to begin with,
much less to kill a giant monster and
scoop out its innards.
It's unfortunate, but I doubt anyone in 
Gerudo Town will be willing to help 
the vai..."
9,Talk_05,"今日は客が多い日だな…

族長様は幼いながらも
民のことを一番に想っておられる優しいお方
こんな大変な時でも
訪問者は通せとおっしゃっているが…
いいか！中に入ることは許可するが
族長様の邪魔だけはするんじゃないぞ！","We've got a lot of visitors today...


The chief may be young, but she's the
kind of leader who puts her people first.

She told me to allow visitors through,
even with the tough times lately...

Hey, listen! Even though I'm letting you
inside, that doesn't mean you can go
getting in the chief's way! Watch out!"
10,Talk_06,"これはゲルドの問題…
お前は知らんでも良いことだ！","This is a Gerudo problem! It is none of
your concern!"
11,Talk_07,失礼がないようにな,Take care not to be rude.
12,Talk_08,"図らずも族長様との話聞こえてしまった…

お前…
ただのハイリアのヴァーイではないようだな
それにしても あの兜をかぶられた族長様を
久々に見たよ
以前は兜が大きく思えたが
今は族長様の方が大きく見えるよ
さあ族長様は監視所でお前をお待ちだ
監視所に一番近いのは南東門だ
もし場所が分からなくなったら
南東門の警備兵に尋ねるんだな","I overheard your conversation with
the chief...

You aren't just a regular Hylian, are you?


Anyway... It's been a while since I've
seen the chief wearing that helm.

It has always looked a little big on her,
if you ask me.

She's headed for the lookout post. If you
take the southeast gate, you'll be closest
to it.
Just ask the guard at the southeast gate
for directions if you get lost."
13,Talk_09,"無礼者！
様をつけんか！様を！
族長様は
まだ幼い身でありながら
我らに心配をかけぬよう
いつも気丈に振る舞われているが…
上の寝室から
時々無邪気な声が聞こえてくるんだ…
寝室にいらっしゃる時だけが
族長様が子供に戻れる時なのだろうな…","Hey! Treat her with due respect and call
her Lady Riju. Her youth doesn't stop
her from looking out for her people!
She puts up a tough front most
of the time, but she does have a
softer side, too...
With all the expectations of leadership,
though, she can only let that side show
when she's in private..."
14,Talk_10,"お前！ ビューラ様を呼び捨てにするなど
なんと恐れ多い！！
そんなことがビューラ様のお耳に届いたら
さすがのお前でもタダでは済まんぞ！！
ビューラ様は
実はこの街一番の槍の使い手なんだ！
私はビューラ様のようになりたくて
幼き頃より槍術を鍛錬してきたんだ
オーラが凄すぎて
まだ近づくことすらできてないが…","\""Tell me about Buliara\""?! How can you
not know about her? It's an insult to
think her name isn't recognized...
Buliara is the best spear master in the
whole town, of course!

She inspired me to take up the spear
when I was young, but despite all my
training, I'm not even close to her skill."
15,Talk_11,"ルージュ様の立派になられたお姿を
先代にも見ていただきたかったよ","I only hope that all of Lady Riju's
predecessors are watching her now, and
they see how commendable she's been."
16,Talk_12,"やはりお前は
ただのヴァーイではなかったようだな
神獣が現れてからというもの
族長様もビューラ様も険しいお顔をされていたが
今はなんと穏やかな事か…

これもみな お前の助けがあったからだ
サークサーク","Seems that you weren't just an average 
Hylian after all.

When the Divine Beast first appeared,
a day didn't go by that the chief and
Buliara didn't look stressed.
But now... Well, it's like years have been
lifted from them.

This is all thanks to you.
Sarqso."
17,Talk_13,"それにしても このメルエナというヴァーイ…
ずいぶん困っているようだが…
何度も来られて こちらも困ってるんだ…

私はここを離れるわけにはいかんと
言っているのに…","This vai, Malena... It looked like
something was bothering her.

She keeps coming back here, and it's
starting to make me worry. But I can't
afford to leave my post right now..."
18,Talk_14,"このメルエナというヴァーイ…
かなり困っているようだが
今は我々も人助けをしている余裕はなくてな
どうしてやることもできんのだ
しかし こんな大変な時でも
族長様は執務を怠らず
訪問者は通せとおっしゃっている

中に入ることは許可するが
族長様の邪魔だけはするんじゃないぞ！","This vai, Malena... It seems like she
really is in desperate need, but we aren't
able to help right now...

can do, but the chief is the kind of leader

won't let any of her official duties slide,
including things that feel unimportant.
She's instructed me to go ahead and
let people who wish to speak with her
come in, regardless of subject matter...
So you may enter, but with a word of
warning. Do not get in the chief's way!"
20,Talk_16,"族長様から雷鳴の兜""奪還の任を受けるとは
お前何者だ？
しかし いくら族長様のお墨付きとはいえ
一筋縄ではいかんと思うぞ
なんといっても盗人達は我々の厳重な警護を
かいくぐる手練れ共だからな
まぁ賊の事を知りたいなら
兵舎にいくといいだろう
あそこにる兵士達は
ずっと賊の捜索をしてたからな詳しいはずだぞ","What makes you so special that the chief
would trust you with retrieving the
Thunder Helm?
Hrmph. Regardless, I hope you are
prepared. This task will not be a
simple one.
The thieves were able to slip past all of
our guards, so they're certainly not
amateurs.
You should head over to the barracks if
you want to learn more...

The soldiers there have been
investigating the theft for a while, so
they should be able to help."
21,Talk_17,今日は客が多い日だな…,We've had a lot of visitors today...
22,Talk_18,"それにしても…

このメルエナというヴァーイ…
かなり困っているようだが

どうしてやることもできんのだ
心が痛いよ…","Even so...


This vai, Malena... It seems like she
really is in desperate need, but we
aren't able to help right now...
It pains me to be unable to do anything..."
23,Talk_21,"族長様のあんな堂々としたお姿
初めて見た気がするよ

監視所に一番近いのは南東門だ

chief look so proud and regal...

She is waiting for you at the lookout

you'll be nearly there.

賊に関しては

but that won't make the thieves any less
formidable.
You should know your enemy well before
you try to move against them.

I'd suggest visiting the barracks and
talking to the soldiers there. They should
know more about the thieves."

was really in need, so I'm glad to see
a smile on her face again.

reassuring to know that she was able to
find help.

can do, but the chief is the kind of leader
