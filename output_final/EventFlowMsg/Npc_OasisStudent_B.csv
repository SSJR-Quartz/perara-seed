My favorite food is the salted rice balls
my vaba likes to make. I've gotten very
good at making them, too.
People say they're almost as good as
hers, even...

Wait, I should say \""grandmother,\"" not
\""vaba.\"" And maybe not \""almost as good.\"""

drink, aren't you?

I'd always heard Hylians turn pretty
red when they've been drinking.

Gerudo don't, really. But we're red
already, so that makes sense.

I wouldn't mind seeing you turn a little
red, though...

Heheh, that sounded silly the moment
I said it..."
