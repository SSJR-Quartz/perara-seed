1,After00,"オレ達は姫しずかという花を求めて
もう数ヶ月も旅しているんだ…
その花に愛を誓うと永遠に幸せになれる
という伝説の花さ
だけど… どこにも見つからないんだ","We've traveled for months in search of
a flower called the silent princess.Legend has it that if you swear your love
before its freshly plucked blossom, you
and your partner will live a charmed life.
Alas, all our searching so far has been
for naught."
2,Atacked00,オゼーユ…早く逃げろ！,"Sorelia! Run, quickly!"
3,Atacked01,くそぉ… やられてたまるか！,"I can't stand constantly being driven
off this way!"
4,Failed00,"いてて…
今のは やばかった…",Heavens... That was a narrow escape.
5,Failed01,"くそぉ…
あんなのに やられちまうなんて…","Curse my weakness for letting that thing
get the better of me..."
6,GoodBye00,"やはり街や村以外に安全な場所など
もう ないんだろうな…
彼女を守れるよう
オレも もっと精進しないとな！","I suppose no place in Hyrule is safe
anymore. Not even the settlements.All the more reason for me to redouble
my training in order to help my beloved
Sorelia!"
7,Guardian00,"早く逃げろ！
ガーディアンが来るぞ！",Run away! The Guardian is coming!
8,Meeting00,"彼女に噂でしか聞いたことがない
姫しずかを見せてあげたいと思ってね…
オレ1人で旅に出るつもりだったんだが
彼女もついてくるって きかなくてさ
オレも腕に自信があったんだが
もっと精進しなければ彼女を守りきれない…","I wanted to find a still-living
silent princess, which we know
only through the tales.I intended to set out on my own, but
Sorelia would have none of it and
insisted on coming along.
I felt confident enough in my skill with
a blade to protect myself, but I need to
reconsider that to keep my beloved safe."
9,Meeting02,私は あなたと一緒にいられるだけで幸せよ,I'm happy just to be together with you.
10,Meeting03,オゼーユ… オレは おまえを一生守る！,"Sorelia... I won't allow any misfortune to
befall you! I swear it!"
11,Near00,助かった…,I'm saved...
12,Near01,オゼーユ…,Sorelia...
13,PairAtacked00,オゼーユ…今助けに行くぞ！,"Sorelia! Stand fast! I'm coming to
save you!"
14,PairAtacked01,妻が まだ魔物に…,"Please help my wife! She's still in danger
from those monsters!"
15,PairFailed00,オゼーユ…無事でいてくれ…,Sorelia... Please be all right...
16,PairFailed01,あぁ… なんてことだ…,No... This can't be happening!
17,SavedLv1_00,"妻ともども助かったよ…
ほんの気持ちだけど受け取ってくれ","You saved not just me but my wife, as
well. We can't spare much, but we owe
you this, at least."
18,SavedLv1_01,"妻も無事みたいだ…
大したものじゃないが お礼をさせてくれ","Is my wife safe, as well? Oh, thank
heavens. I don't know how I'd go on
living without her."
19,SavedLv2_00,"いやー… あんた強いんだねえ
ほんとに助かったよ
これは お礼だ！受け取ってくれ","You've done what neither my wife nor
I could have, and we're alive as a result.
Thank you."
20,SavedLv2_01,"あんたのおかげで助かったよ
ほんとに ありがとう
これは お礼だ！取っといてくれ","Do you wander Hyrule keeping everyone
safe? You're doing good work. Here,
this is to show my appreciation."
21,SavedLv3_00,"あんた すごいじゃないか
命の恩人だ！
ぜひ お礼をさせてくれ！","It's a miracle that you stepped in to
save us. Let me do this much for you."
22,SavedLv3_01,"いったい何者なんだい？
あんたみたいな人が勇者と呼ばれるんだろうな
ぜひ お礼をさせてくれ！","There aren't many heroes in the world
like you anymore. I think Sorelia and I
can part with this as a thank-you gift."
