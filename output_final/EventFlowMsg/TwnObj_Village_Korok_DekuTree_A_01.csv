己の真の体力で挑まねばならぬのじゃ
はたして今の主に抜けるかどうか
しかと見とどけさせてもらおう","If you hope to extract the sword, you'll
need to summon a hero's strength.

Let us see how brightly your life force
burns.

2,DekuTree_A_01_Talk010,"いくら体力があるように見せかけても
この剣には全てお見通しよ
この剣を抜きたければ
己の真の体力で挑まねばならぬのじゃ
はたして今の主に抜けるかどうか
しかと見とどけさせてもらおう","The sword cares not for your physical
might. It is moved by what lies within.

It cuts through bravado and superficial
enhancements. Only true strength can
draw it from its resting place.
The only way to know if you have what
it takes...is to try."
3,DekuTree_A_01_Talk020,"マスターソードは厄災ガノンや奴の怨念を
帯びし者に対すれば聖なる光をまとうであろう
その時剣は真の力を発揮する…
だが過信は禁物じゃぞ
無駄に振り回せば傷付き いずれ使えなくなる
…そうなれば剣の回復を待たねばならぬのだ
ガノンを討つのなら その剣にのみ頼るは危険
万全を期し神獣を解放しておくことも考えよ…
あの娘…姫巫女の笑顔
わしも今一度見てみたいものよ…","When used against Calamity Ganon or
those tinged with its Malice, the
Master Sword will shroud itself in light.
It is then that the true power of the
sword will manifest. But you cannot rely
solely on the power of the blade.
If you swing it about recklessly, it will
forget its purpose and be rendered
powerless for a time.
Should this happen, you must wait for
the sword to recover.

It would be foolish to rely on the sword
alone if you mean to defeat Ganon.

You should also consider freeing the
Divine Beasts in order to improve your
position.
I would most like to see her smiling face
again... The lost princess."
