阻止しようとした命知らずが おったらしいで
名前は何や…言うてたな
忘れたわ","The Great Calamity was a catastrophe
that...contaminated Hyrule Castle. That's
how I understood it, anyway.
Our world was once filled with beautiful
cities and prosperous villages, but the
Calamity destroyed all of that.
Luckily, Hateno Village was far enough
away from Hyrule Castle that the damage
here was minor in comparison.
And then there was something about a
brave soul that tried to stop the Calamity,
I think...
I don't remember it all. What does it
matter, though? That's all in the past."
