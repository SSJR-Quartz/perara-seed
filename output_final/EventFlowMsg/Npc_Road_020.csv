10,Atacked00,"トレジャーハンターの俺だけど
魔物を倒す訓練はしてないからなぁ…","I'm a treasure hunter, not a monster

11,Atacked01,"魔物なんか相手にしていたら
命がいくつあっても足りないよ！","The thing about being a treasure hunter
is...if you're smart, then you wait until
the monsters are gone before you start."

47,Failed01,"イタタタ…
トレジャーハンター一生の不覚…","Oof... The life of a treasure hunter is
fraught with danger, but I never thought
this would happen to me."
48,GoodBye00,ではサラバ…,"For now, farewell..."
49,Guardian00,"ガーディアンは まだ動いてるぞ！
逃げるが勝ちだ！","That Guardian's still moving! No way I'm
going near one of those if it's still got
any life left in it!"
50,MSG_Futa_00,"…キミは気づいたか？
この辺りにガーディアンの残骸が多いことを…
これで敵の侵入を防げるはずだと信じた
村人たちの夢の跡さ…","Have you noticed all the wreckage
around here? It's the remains of
Guardians, destroyed long ago...
The villagers thought that they would
protect them from any enemies...

Take a look around you. Everywhere you
look, you'll see it. The ruined dreams of
those villagers."
51,MSG_Futa_00_1,"ガーディアンは敵の侵入を防いてくれる兵器…
少なくとも村の人達はそう信じてたはずだ…","Guardians were built as a weapon to fend
off enemies... That's what the people
who made them wanted, at any rate."
52,MSG_Futa_01,"ここからずっと北の北""アッカレ地方の端っこに
ガーディアンのパーツを買い取る男がいてね
俺がトレジャーハンターやっていけるのも
そいつのおかげさ","Go far to the north, up to Akkala, and
you'll find a man who deals in Guardian
parts.
He's half my business, truth be told. As
long as he's in the market, I can keep
treasure hunting until I get my big break."
53,MSG_Futa_01_1,"ここからずっと北にあるアッカレ古代研究所に
ガーディアンのパーツを買い取る男がいるんだ","If you head far north from here up to
Akkala, you'll find the man who deals
in the Guardian parts I sell."
54,MSG_Futa_02,"…油の匂いは好きか？
調理用じゃなくて機械用の油の話さ
ガーディアンの残骸を朝から晩まで運ぶ俺の
もはや体臭といってもいいかもしれない","You smell that? That's the smell
of grease—not for cooking, but
for keeping machines running!
I've got a lot of Guardian parts on me,
all day, every day, so that smell of grease
follows me everywhere I go."
55,MSG_Futa_02_1,"俺の血液は機械用の油でできている…

毎日ガーディアンの残骸を運んでると
そんな感じに なっちゃうんだよ","I spend so much time around these
machines that I'm starting to think
I've got grease for blood.
When you spend your whole life around
Guardian wreckage and parts, your mind
starts playing tricks on you."
56,MSG_Futa_03,"それにしても切ない話さ…

人々を守るために作られたガーディアンが
今では その人々から忌み嫌われてる…","It's a sad story, when you think about it.


These Guardians now hunt down the
people they were made to protect."
57,MSG_Futa_03_1,"人々を守るために作られたガーディアンだが
今となっちゃ鼻つまみ者さ…","The Guardians were made to defend
people. It must be so hard to see
what they've become..."
58,MSG_Futa_04,"この村にも学者さんがいるって聞いてたけど
最近見かけなくなったらしいんだよね
ガーディアンのパーツを
買い取ってもらおうと思ってたんだけどな…","There's supposed to be a research nut
around here too, but no one's seen
her in a while.
Maybe I should go hit up the lab, see if
they'd be interested in Guardian parts."
59,MSG_Futa_04_1,"この村の学者さん…
一体 どこに行ったんだろうね","I wonder what the researchers around
these parts do all day..."
60,Near00,古代の素材はなぁ…,Hm. Ancient parts...
61,Near01,古代のネジ…,An ancient screw...
62,Near02,古代の歯車…,Hm. An ancient gear...
63,Near03,古代のコア…,An ancient core?
64,Near04,雨か…,"Great, rain..."
65,Rest_00,"ハテノ砦付近にあるガーディアンの残骸から
使えそうな古代パーツを拾い集めているが…
こいつがまた良い値で売れるのさ！
","I'm salvaging any ancient parts I can
find from the Guardian remains near
Fort Hateno...
You know what they say—one man's
trash is another man's treasure!"
66,Rest_01,"雨の日は ジャンク屋はお手上げさ
ガラクタとはいえ錆びるのも残念だしね","Business really suffers on rainy days
like this. I'm not sure if these hunks of
junk rust, but I wouldn't want to find out."
67,Rest_02,"よく降るなあ…
雨がやむまで ここで待つしかないな","It's coming down hard... I guess I'll have
to wait here until it clears up."
68,RetMSG_Futa_00,"俺が何してるかって？
いい質問だ！
俺は古代パーツの残骸を拾い集めている！
そう！この俺は トレジャーハンター！
この辺りはガーディアンの残骸が多いので
少しばかり興奮してるってわけさ！","What am I doing, you ask? Good 
question, I say! I am on a mission,
collecting ancient parts.
You guessed it! I'm a treasure hunter!
And there are a LOT of ruined Guardians
around here, so I'm a little bit excited!"
69,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,"この辺はガーディアンの残骸が多いから
トレジャーハントが捗るぜ！","There are lots of ruined Guardians
around here, which is good news
for treasure hunters."
70,RetMSG_Futa_01,"ここから西に行けばハテノ砦だぜ！

…あとは そうだな
とくに情報はなしだ！","It's just a short hike west from here to
Fort Hateno. Let's see... What can I
tell you about that place...
Um... Eh, nothing really comes to mind."
71,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,"ここから西にあるのがハテノ砦だ！
行くなら死角にいる魔物に気を付けるこったな","If you head west a bit farther, you'll
hit Fort Hateno! Watch your back, if
you do go. There be monsters about!"
72,RetMSG_Futa_02,"ちょっと聞くけど俺の仕事…
単なる ガラクタ集めに見えてたりする？
時には魔物に襲われる事もあるしさ
危険と隣合わせの タフな仕事なんだけどなぁ","I know what you're thinking. \""A treasure
hunter? Why, that's nothing but a
glorified junk collector!\""
First of all, that's really harsh. And
second, it's tougher than it looks. I get
attacked by monsters all the time!"
73,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"俺の仕事… トレジャーハンターは
こう見えて タフな仕事なんだぜ
周囲の理解が無いのが悲しいぜ…","My job? I suppose my business cards
would read \""treasure hunter,\"" but some
folks might call me a junk collector...
Look, I know it may not seem it at first
glance, but this is a TOUGH job. And
nobody understands... It makes me sad..."
74,RetMSG_Futa_03,"拾い集めたガーディアンのパーツを
どうするのかって？
アッカレ古代研究所の学者さんが
いい値段で買い取ってくれるのさ！
でも ちょっと待てよ？

まさかガーディアンを修復してたりして！","You wanna know what I do with all the
Guardian parts I find?

There's a gentleman who works at the
Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. He never turns
down the parts I bring him.
Hey, hang on a minute...


You don't suppose he's actually
repairing the Guardians, do you?!"
75,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"ガーディアンのパーツ""アッカレ古代研究所の
学者さんが買い取ってくれるはいいけど…
ガーディアンを修復してたら ヤバいな…","There's a scientist of some sort over at
the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab who loves
it when I bring him Guardian parts.
Wait, what if he's repairing Guardians?
That would be bad..."
76,RetMSG_Futa_04,"ハテノ砦付近にあるガーディアンの残骸から
使えそうな古代パーツを拾い集めるのさ！
…オーケー？","I'm collecting ancient parts from any
ruined Guardian remains I find near
Fort Hateno!
Don't judge me."
77,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"ハテノ砦のガーディアンから拾える古代パーツ
俺より先に取らないでくれよな！","I'm out collecting ancient parts from
ruined Guardian remains near
Fort Hateno! Don't you beat me to 'em!"
78,SavedLv1_00,"キミのおかげで命びろいさ！
…っていうのは ちょっと大げさかな？","If it hadn't been for you, why, I'd be
monster grub right now! Well, maybe
that's an exaggeration—but it feels true!"
79,SavedLv1_01,"トレジャーハンターともあろう この俺が
キミに助けられちゃったか！","Fancy that! A seasoned treasure hunter
like myself, rescued by a wandering hero
like you! It's the stuff of fairy tales!"
80,SavedLv2_00,"あぶなかった…けっこうヤバかった…
キミがいて ほんとよかった！","That was close... A little too close for my
tastes. I'm lucky you were here for me."
81,SavedLv2_01,"生きた心地が しなかったよ！
助けてくれて ありがとな！","I was convinced my treasure-hunting
days were over! Thanks for saving my
skin, pal."
82,SavedLv3_00,"何とか助かったって感じだ！
もちろん キミのおかげだよ！","I thought for sure I was a goner. I'm
never going to forget this, pal."
83,SavedLv3_01,"キミのおかげで命びろいさ！
…いや大げさでも何でもなく！","This is no exaggeration, but if you
hadn't come along, I wouldn't be
alive right now. I just know it."
84,Talk01,"…ところで キミ！

ガーディアンの残骸とかには
興味あるかい？","Hey, question for you!


Do you have any interest in Guardian
remains?"
85,Talk02,他に何かあるか？,Do you need anything else?
86,Thanks00,ぜひ お礼を受け取ってくれ！,"Please take this as a sign of my
gratitude."
87,talk00,やあ！俺はトレジャーハンターのベリスだ！,"Hey. The name's Teli! I'm a bit of a
treasure hunter, if you get my drift."
88,talk01,"世界というか この辺りを股にかける
トレジャーハンター！それが俺！ ベリスだ！","Hey. You're probably wondering, \""Is this
the guy everyone's talking about?\""

\""The dashing treasure hunter Teli, with
his roguish good looks?\"" Yep, that's me."
