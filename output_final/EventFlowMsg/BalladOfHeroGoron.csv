Huh. Popular subject these days.

Not too long ago, a Rito bard came by
wantin' to know all about him. I told him
about all kinds of things. For example...
About the Boulder Breaker, Daruk's
weapon of choice. I told him how heavy
it is and how its power is unmatched.
You know the valley at Gortram Cliff,
southwest of Gorko Tunnel?

It was made by Daruk with his
Boulder Breaker in one night!"

easier for us Gorons to get all that
tasty rock roast!
That Rito fella seemed to like the other
story I told him better, though.

good friend who liked to eat as much
as he did.
I don't have much of an appetite myself,
