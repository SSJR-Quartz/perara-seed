9,talk01,"あなたって旅の人よね？

だったら ちょっと聞いて！","You're a traveler, aren't you?


Then listen up!"
10,talk02,"あの雪山の頂上に
3本の杉の木があるの見える？","You see those three trees up on top of
that snowy mountain there?"
11,talk03,"家にあった古い本を読んでたらね
ページに挟まって小さな手紙が出てきて…
『3本を1本にし それを背にして海に進め
岩に閉ざされし試練が眠る』
って書いてあったの","I found a small letter stuck between the
pages of this old book at my house...

It said, \""When the three summit trees
become one, turn your back to them and
head toward the sea.
A trial encased in stone awaits you
there.\"" I don't know what that means!"
12,talk04,"きっと あの三本杉から東の
アーモシア海岸の方に進め って事よ！ 
その後の「岩に閉ざされし試練が眠る」は
試練を超えた先に財宝があるんじゃない？！","But maybe it means we have to head to
Afromsia Coast, which is just east of
those three trees on the mountain! 
For the \""trial encased in stone...\"" bit,
I wonder if you get some kind of treasure
for doing that..."
13,talk05,あら おはよう,Mornin'.
14,talk06,あら こんにちは,Good day.

18,talk10,旅のお方？,Are you a traveler?
19,talk11,"あら？その青い炎って

as the one Purah has?"
20,talk12,"その青い炎…早くプルアお婆様に
持ってってあげなさいな","You'd better hurry and take that
blue flame over to Purah's."
21,talk13,あらら…残念ね,"Oh, dear... What a shame."
22,talk14,"あら また来たのね？
私の話聞いてくれるのかしら？","Oh, you're back? Got a second to chat?"
23,talk15,すぅ すぅ,Zzz...zzz...
24,talk17,"財宝は見つかったかしら？

それにしても「財宝の権利をあげる」は
言い過ぎたわ…
今から七三にならないかしら？","Did you happen to find the treasure...
by any chance?

I guess it probably wasn't fair of me to
expect you to do all of the exploring
and adventuring...
But maybe we could split the treasure
seventy-thirty or something like that?"
25,talk18,"三本杉の先…
アーモシア海岸の方には行った？","Beyond the three summit trees... Did you
ever make it over Afromsia Coast?"
26,talk19,ん…旅の人？,"Hmm... You look like a traveler type 
to me."
27,talk20,"晴れてたら旅の人に見て欲しい物が
あったんだけど雨じゃ仕方無いか…","There's something I've been waiting to
show to an adventurous soul...but I 
can't do it when it's raining like this."
28,talk21,"冗談よ！

私今の生活で十分満足してるし
身の丈ってのがあるじゃないねぇ？","Ah, I'm just kidding!


I'm plenty satisfied with what I have in
my life as it is. The key is to always live
within your means, you know?"
29,talk22,"でも私…子供も居るし
雪山を越えての旅は なかなかねぇ…
だからこの権利 あなたにあげるわ！
旅人なら見つけてみて！財宝！","But I have a child! I can't just go off
on a journey across the mountains...

But you can do that, right?! You'd be
great at that! Go on! Head out there and
bring us back that treasure!"
30,talk23,"…

どうしたの？浮かない顔して","Eh?


What's wrong? Why the long face?"
31,talk25,"えっ祠…？！

なぁ～んだぁ～…
財宝じゃないのか～～…
ありがとうこれでスッキリしたわ
財宝だと思ったんだけどなぁ…","A shrine?


That's it? No treasure?


Well...thanks for looking into it. I guess
I'm kinda relieved. But I was really
hoping there'd be some treasure..."
32,talk26,"三本杉の先には
祠があっただけなのね…
それだったらこの村にもあるし要らないわ","Beyond the three summit trees...
there was only a shrine, huh?

We have our very own shrine here
in the village, so I'm not so impressed..."
33,talk27,だったら ちょっとついて来て,"In that case, follow me for a minute."
34,talk28,"あら？その青い炎って
所長さんの…","That blue flame... Wait, isn't that the

38,talk32,"はーい お待たせ旅の人！

せっかくだから ちょっと聞いて！","Thanks for waitin', traveler!


Why don't you take a moment and lemme
tug on your tunic for a second...speakin'
figuratively, of course."
39,talk33,それじゃ またね！,"All right, see ya later! "
40,talk34,"若い子が声かけてくれるのは嬉しいんだけど
さすがに もう寝るわ…","I'm flattered that a young man like
yourself wants to chew the fat,
but these bones need their sleep..."
