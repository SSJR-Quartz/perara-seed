1,Atacked00,どうしよう…怖い…,"Oh, no... I'm scared..."
2,Atacked01,もう…覚悟はできてる…,I'm... I'm ready...
3,Failed00,"こ…ここは天国？
ではなくて私…生きてるみたいね…","Am... Am I dead? This looks different
than I'd expected. Unless I'm still
alive?"
4,Failed01,もうイヤ…何でこんな目に…,"I hate this... What did I do
to deserve this?"
5,Guardian00,"逃げたほうがよさそうよ！
ガーディアンが来る前に！","Run away! Get out of here!
There's a Guardian coming!"
6,MSG_Futa_00,"キミって気温はもちろん
気分と服装も合わせてそうな気がするな
こんな世の中だからこそ
オシャレを楽しむ余裕が大事って思うでしょ？","Dressing for the weather is fine, but be
sure to express yourself. Dress how you
feel, and let your heart be your stylist!
What's the point in living in such a
beautiful world if you don't dress
beautifully too?"
7,MSG_Futa_00_1,"こんな世の中だからこそ オシャレを楽しむの！
心の余裕っていうのかなー","When things get bad and the world looks
bleak, it's important to let your fashion
shine. You can't let the sadness win."
8,MSG_Futa_01,"ねぇキミ…
寒かったり暑かったりとか大丈夫？
寒い地域と暑い地域では
服を着替えるのが快適に過ごすコツよ
ちゃんと着替えを持って旅してるんでしょ？","Quick question for you... How do you
do when the weather gets...extreme?
You know, like, too hot or too cold?
If you want to stay comfy, the key is 
to change your outfit to match the
temperature.
That's why you should always pack
a spare change of clothes when
you're exploring!"
9,MSG_Futa_01_1,"寒い地域や暑い地域では ちゃんと着替える事！
これが快適に過ごすコツよ！","If you find yourself getting uncomfortably
hot or cold, it's probably time you
considered a change of clothes."
10,MSG_Futa_02,"…どうしたの？
おねえさん当ててみようか？
服を買いに行きたいから
カカリコ村の場所を知りたいんでしょ？
ここから北に向かって歩けばいいの
値段が高いけど いい服が買えるのよね","Why the long face? 
I bet I could guess!

You're in the mood for a new outfit, but
you don't know where Kakariko Village is.
Am I right?
All you need to do is head north! Their
prices tend to be on the more expensive 
side, but the clothes are top-notch!"
11,MSG_Futa_02_1,"服を買うなら北のカカリコ村よ
いい服売ってるんだよねー高いけど…","If you're looking for a new outfit, you
should visit Kakariko Village. Things can
run a bit pricey, but they're worth it."
12,MSG_Futa_03,"キミが着こなしている服
似合ってて かっこいいわよ
おねえさんの服？
じつはこれ オーダーメイドなの
せっかくだから
お互いの着こなし褒めあいましょ！","That outfit you're wearing... It looks so
dashing, so heroic!

Oh, my outfit? It is lovely, isn't it?
Actually, I had this custom made!

This isn't weird at all to you, is it? Two
strangers on the road, praising one
another's impeccable taste?"
13,MSG_Futa_03_1,"何を隠そう おねえさんの服 オーダーメイドなの
でも誰も気づいてくれないんだよね…","I get all my clothes custom made. Not
that anyone ever notices... True fashion
sense is sometimes too subtle for most."
14,MSG_Futa_04,"…でっしぇ でっしぇ～♪

あ…ハテノ村にある染物屋さん知らない？
「でっしぇ」って そこのご主人の口ぐせなの
もしも服を染めたくなった時は
その染物屋さんが オススメよ","Today is a good day...to dye!


Wait, do you not know about the dye
shop in Hateno Village? The shopkeeper
always has these awful puns...
But if you ever want to change up your
look, you should swing by. Hue won't
regret it! HA!"
15,MSG_Futa_04_1,"でっしぇ でっしぇ でっしぇっしぇ～♪

ハテノ村の染物屋さんいい味出してるのよ
彼の口ぐせで歌作っちゃうくらい","\""The colors of these fabrics are just
to dye for!\""

If you ever talk to the owner of the dye
shop in Hateno Village, you'd better
have a high tolerance for lethal puns."
16,Near00,朝はニガテ…,Mornings are the WORST.
17,Near01,新しい服 ほしいな～,I want some new clothes...
18,Near02,何食べよっかナ,Hm... What to eat...
19,Near03,目がショボショボ…,My eyes are so tired...
20,Near04,ああ もう…,Not good...
21,Rest_00,"馬につける「くら」や 「手綱」…
せっかくなら オシャレな方がいいと思わない？
馬具の着け替えは馬宿でやってるわよ","If you're gonna need saddles and bridles
anyway...you might as well make them
as stylish as possible, don't you think? 
If you decide to take my advice and swap
your horse's gear, a stable's the place to
do it. Your horse will thank you!"
22,Rest_01,"雨の日に濡れないコツはね…
フフフ…出歩かないことよ","Here's the secret to keeping dry on a
rainy day... And you can't tell ANYONE...
Simply don't go outside."
23,Rest_02,"…もしかして雨がうれしいの？
そんな事ないわよね","You mean to tell me you LIKE the rain?
That's ridiculous. Your clothes smell
like wet dog!"
24,RetMSG_Futa_00,"キミって ちょっと違うわね
着こなしとか身のこなしがスマートだもの
ここだけの話…双子馬宿を利用する旅人って
どこか垢抜けてないのよね","You're not like the others. You're so
fit, so stylish.

Just between you and me...the sorts of
folks who visit the Dueling Peaks Stable
aren't exactly the pinnacle of fashion..."
25,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,"双子馬宿にいる人達も もうちょっと
オシャレに敏感になってほしい って感じ","I don't like to judge people, but...
Oh, who am I kidding? I love judging
people!
Take the folks at Dueling Peaks Stable for
instance. I wish those yokels had at least
a little basic fashion sense."
26,RetMSG_Futa_01,"キミって着こなしが上手…

言われたことある？
なかったとしたら みんな見る目ないのよ","You've got a real eye for coordinating
your, uh...outfit there.

Just take what I say. I have the keenest
eye for fashion in the land."
27,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,"キミの着こなし そこそこスタイリッシュよね
他の旅人は そういうの気にしないのかなー？","You've got a good eye for fashion.
Do adventurers just not care about
that sort of thing anymore?"
28,RetMSG_Futa_02,"ああ…着替えたい着替えたい
新しい服に着替えたい…
この街道を北に歩けばカカリコ村があって
いろいろな服を買うことができるんだけど…
オシャレに お金使いすぎちゃって…","My favorite part about traveling is finding
new fashions in the places you visit...
I love discovering new looks!
Like, if you keep taking this path north,
you'll wind up in Kakariko Village. They
have some of my favorite clothes ever.
I'd be there right now, if I hadn't already
blown my last few rupees on this
stunning neckerchief..."
29,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"カカリコ村で新しい服買っちゃおうかなー
どうしよーかなー","I'm thinking about picking up some new
clothes in Kakariko Village. I just don't
know if I can justify the cost..."
30,RetMSG_Futa_03,"…もしかして おねえさんに
服装チェックしてもらいたいとか？
あ…そういうことじゃないのね
ごめんなさい","What is it? Did you want me to
evaluate your fashion sense?

No? Well, fine. You probably wouldn't
have liked what I had to say anyway."
31,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"服装チェックしてほしいの？

……

ごめんちょっと何とも言えない感じ","You want me to give you a quick fashion
assessment? Sure thing. Let me just...

...


Yeah, sorry. I don't even know where
to begin..."
32,RetMSG_Futa_04,"この服の色…
なんだか飽きてきちゃったな
久しぶりにハテノ村の染物屋に行って
別の色に染めてもらおっかなぁ","I don't know... I'm just so tired of this
color. Maybe I'll visit the dye shop in
Hateno Village to refresh my look."
33,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"この服ハテノ村の染物屋に行って
別の色に染め直してもらおっかなぁ","I love this top, but I think I'm just getting
bored of the colors. Maybe it's time for a
stop at the dye shop in Hateno Village."
34,SavedLv1_00,"キミって なかなかやるのね
ありがと！","You're pretty handy with the killing!
Thanks!"
35,SavedLv1_01,"どうなるかって思っちゃった
ありがと！","I wasn't expecting an ambush!
Thanks for helping me out."
36,SavedLv2_00,"キミがいてくれて よかった…
どうも ありがとう","I'm so glad you were here to help...
I can't thank you enough."
37,SavedLv2_01,キミが いてくれなかったらと思うと…,"If you hadn't come... I really don't want
to think what could have happened."
38,SavedLv3_00,"キミは私の命の恩人よ！
大げさでも何でもなく！","You've saved my life! I mean it.
No exaggeration here."
39,SavedLv3_01,キミがいなかったら私は今ごろ…,"I dread to think what could have
happened..."
40,Thanks00,これ助けてくれたお礼よ,"Here, this is for rescuing me."
