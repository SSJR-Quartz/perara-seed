そうとうな弓の使い手とみたね～
あたしはね～
弓を使う男性に目がなくてね～
どうだい？
あたしを弓で楽しませてくれないかい？","That's right, my good man! I knew it the
moment I saw ya...

I had you figured for one heck of an
archer. And I'm head over heels for a
fine slice of man that can use a bow!
So how about it? Why not take out that
bow and show me something special?"
12,Talk04,"お客さんノリがいいさね～

じゃあ村の女神像の燭台に
火をつけてきてくれるかいさね～","I like your attitude! All you gotta do is
light the torches by the Goddess Statue.

home. I don't know who put it there,
but it's been there forever."

…ああ ごめんよ～
あたしに何か用さね？","Mmm... An archer with a strong build...
I could look at you all day!

...Oh! Sorry—my imagination ran away
with me. Did you need something?"
17,Talk09,"あたしを楽しませてくれる男は
いないもんかねぇ～","Where can I find the perfect man to show
me a feat of skill..."
