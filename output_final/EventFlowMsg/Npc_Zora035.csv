この石碑には過去にドレファン王がしたためた
ゾーラの歴史が書かれておるゾラ
此度一冊の本にしようかと思うて
読み返しておるゾラよ","Hmm... A traveler, eh?


Upon this stone monument is the proud
history of the Zora, as dictated by
King Dorephan himself many years ago.
I plan to record it all in a book, 
so I am reading it again."

Link?!


Is that really you?


The Hylian...who stole away our
Lady Mipha! And what's more,
the Champion who...
I...I cannot forgive you! Not ever!"
17,talk03,"それで許されると思うたかーッ？！

オヌシらハイリア人は 100年前
厄災ガノンを止められなかっただけでなく
ワシらからミファー様を奪ったゾラ！

ワシは絶対に お前らハイリア人を許さんゾラ！
絶対に！","Do you not understand the gravity of
what you have done?!

Not only did you Hylians fail to stop 
Calamity Ganon 100 years ago...

But you went and stole our Lady Mipha
from us!

I will never forgive you awful Hylians!
Not ever!"

ゾーラの過去を研究し
未来へと伝える歴史学者だゾラ","Link... It seems that...I was wrong
about you.

Seeing Divine Beast Vah Ruta's
form there...

Even though we lost Lady Mipha,
it seems she can still help you fight
against Calamity Ganon...
Oh! I am sorry I did not introduce
myself sooner. I am Jiahto.

I am a historian who studies Zora history
and preserves it for future generations."
21,talk10,"それにしても ドレファン王がしたためた
と言われる この石碑は もうボロボロ…
おそらく里の外の10基の石碑も
同じ状態である事は間違いないゾラ
そこでワシは全ての石碑の内容をまとめ
一冊の本にしようと思うとるゾラが
この老いた足腰ヒレでは10基全ての石碑を
見て回るには時間がかかり過ぎるゾラ","Even so, this stone monument that
King Dorephan supposedly wrote...
It's torn to pieces now.
Most likely, the 10 stone monuments
outside of the domain are in the same
awful condition.
I'm thinking about collecting the
contents of all of the stone monuments
and compiling them into a book.
But with these old legs and fins,
traveling to all 10 stone monuments
will take a great deal of time."
22,talk11,"なので リンク…お願いじゃ
","That is why... Link... I'd like to ask a
favor of you."
23,talk12,"ゾーラの里の周辺にある10基全ての石碑を探し

monuments around Zora's Domain

in the matter."
25,talk14,"おお！助かるゾラ！
英傑自らが探してくれるとは心強い！
石碑の中には なにやらお宝の在処が
書かれているものも あった気がするゾラ
そのお宝見つけられたらオヌシのもの
おそらく ゾーラには必要ないものじゃろうて
いいかゾーラの里の周辺の10基の石碑ゾラ
それでは頼んだ！","Oh! Thank you! You truly are a lifesaver!
How reassuring that the Champion will
search for those monuments for me!
I have it on good authority that among
the stone monuments, one has the
location of some treasure written on it.
If you happen to find said treasure,
feel free to keep it. It will most likely be
something that a Zora wouldn't need.
Yes, you'll find the 10 stone monuments
around Zora's Domain... I believe in you.

In fact, I'm counting on you!"
26,talk15,"ふむ…リンクか
","Hmph... Link, eh?"
27,talk16,"老い先短いワシの役目は

Will you hear my request?"
29,talk18,"どうした？石碑が見つからないゾラ？

オヌシがまだ調べていない石碑の
だいたいの場所なら教えてやれるゾラが…","What is wrong? Are you unable to find
all of the stone monuments?

I can perhaps tell you the location 
of a stone monument you have yet
to investigate..."
