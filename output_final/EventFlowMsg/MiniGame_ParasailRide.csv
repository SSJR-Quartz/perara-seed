14,"""0014""",もうケッコー,"Nah, I'll pass."
15,Again,"さて どうする？
もう一度するかい？","Are you satisfied for the day? Or would
you like to train again?"
16,AskMoney_00,興味を持ってくれて嬉しいよ,"It lifts my spirits to hear of your keen
interest."
17,AskMoney_01,"訓練の準備に20ルピー使うけど
それでもいいかな？","I require 20 rupees to set up a course
for you to train. Is that acceptable?"
18,Exit_00,"まるでコッコみたいだね
飛べる以外も ボクらに似てきたみたいだ
後片付けはしておくからね
また来てくれるのを楽しみにしてるよ","Yes, you are much like a Cucco. First you
fly, and now you cluck. Most intriguing.I look forward to seeing you again."
19,Explain_00,"風は""時に速く時に緩やかに
自由自在に吹きぬけていくだろう？
風になるには その動きを真似るのが
一番の方法だと思ってね
空中にリングを浮かべて その中をくぐる
っていう訓練をしているんだ
着地するまでの間に
できるだけ多くのリングを通過するのさ
後悔はさせないよ
どうだい やってみないかい？","The wind is stormy or calm by turns but
always moves as it will. I seek to emulate
its freedom by mimicking its movements.
To that end, I have devised a training
program that involves flying through
rings suspended in the air.
Should you choose to undertake this
training, I promise that you will find it
enriching."
20,Initial,キミは どうしてここまで来たんだい？,What are you doing all the way up here?
21,Initial_00_00,"そうか それは大変だったね
キミは高いところが好きなのかな
ボクも高いところは好きだよ
風の声が よく聴こえるからね","You must be drawn to heights.You and I have that in common. It is
only from here that I can properly hear
the wind."
22,Initial_01_00,"そうか それは残念だったね
ここにあるのは この奇妙な建物だけさ
ん ボクかい？ そうだね…
自由を探しに ってところかな","Then you are in for disappointment.
The only object to be found here is this
strange building.
What is my purpose here, you ask?
I suppose...I am here to find my freedom.
In a manner of speaking."
23,Initial_02,"ボクはね何にも縛られずに生きたいんだ
どこまでも自由気ままな風のようにね
だから ここで風の声を聴いているんだ
少しでも自由になれる気がしてね
キミも
風になりたいと思うことは無いかい？","I want to live as the wind does—free and
unrestricted. To bide here and listen to
its voice offers a taste of that freedom.
Don't you long to be like the wind too?"
24,Initial_05,"キミとはなんだか友達になれそうだよ
ハイリア人の友達なんて初めてだ
おや…？ キミにはどうやら
ボクらとは違った形の翼があるみたいだね
いつもボクがしている風になる訓練を
キミもしてみるかい？","I think we will be fast friends. I've never
felt such kinship with a Hylian before.Your style of wing is different than mine
but similar enough that I think you could
undergo my training to become the wind."
25,Initial_06,"やあ
風になる訓練をしに来たのかい？","Greetings, my Hylian friend. Have you
returned to train to become the wind?"
26,Initial_End,"そうかい… キミとは考えが違うみたいだ
悪いけど邪魔をしないでもらえるかな","I see. There is a gulf in our thinking on
the matter, then. Please leave me in
peace that I may hear the wind's voice."
27,Land,"さてと…
それじゃあ飛べない友達を迎えに行こうか","Hmmm. Stay there and I will come
collect you, my flightless friend."
28,Near00,気持ちの良い風だ,Fine wind today.
29,Near01,雨風も悪くない,The wind and rain dance...
30,NoEnoughMoney_00,"少し足りないみたいだね…
残念ながら ボクも余裕はないんだ
今日は風の声を聴くだけにしようか
また余裕のある時に声をかけてほしいな","Hmm. No. I need more than what you
have. For you see, I can contribute no
resources of my own.
Fortunately for both of us, attending to
the voice of the wind is free. We can
train again some other day."
31,Rain_00,"こんな雨の日は自由に飛ぶのは難しいけど
頑張ってくれよ","Flying during a downpour is not for the
faint of heart. I bid you good luck."
32,ReadyStart_00,"それじゃ少し準備をするから
キミはここで待っていてね","You should wait here while I prepare
the course for you."
33,ReadyStart_01,"遅くなって ゴメンね
いつでも飛んでくれて構わないよ","That took longer than I expected. My
apologies. But it is ready now for you
to fly whenever you are ready."
34,ReadyStart_02,"キミが飛ぶのをやめた時点で
ボクが迎えに行くから""心配しないでね","I will be ready to swoop in whenever
you tire of flying, so do not worry
yourself on that account."
35,Result_00_00,"あれ？個か…
どうやらキミを過信していたみたいだね…","Hmm? How many rings did you achieve?
? I appear to have overestimated
your skill a bit, it seems."
36,Result_00_01,"まだ飛ぶのに慣れていないのかな？
ボクと訓練していくのも いいかもね","You may be unaccustomed to flying.
But this is nothing a bit of practice on
my course can't correct."
37,Result_01_00,"ふーん個かぁ
惜しかったけど風になれた とは言えないね","Hmm... rings. A fair showing, but
you are not yet one with the wind."
38,Result_01_01,でも残念賞をあげるよ,"Still, I suppose you deserve this
participation award."
39,Result_02_00,"すごいよ個だなんて！
ボクらリト族でも なかなか出せない記録だ！","You achieved  rings?! That is 
wonderful! Your score is unsurpassed,
even by we Rito!"
40,Result_02_01,"これは キミが風になれたお祝いだよ
よければ受け取ってほしいな","You have truly become one with the
wind, and so I must insist that you
accept this reward."
41,Result_03_00,"個か なかなかのもんだね！
翼の扱いに慣れてきたんじゃないか！","You achieved  rings, hm? Very
good. You take to your strange wings
quite well."
42,Result_03_01,"これ受け取ってくれよ
","Here, this is for you."
43,Result_04_00,"信じられないよ個だなんて！
キミは本当にハイリア人なのかい！","?! Unbelievable... Are you certain
that you're not a Rito in disguise?!"
44,Result_04_01,"良いものを見せてもらったお礼だ！
受け取ってほしいな","To see you soar was a rare treat.
Here, you deserve to be rewarded
in kind."
45,Suggest_Bay,"今のおすすめは… こっち側の道かな
ゆったりと動くのも悪くないものだよ","I recommend...the route over there.
It can be enjoyable to waft along on
a calm breeze."
46,Suggest_End,"もちろん どこに行くのもキミの自由だ
どこへ行こうと風はキミを迎えてくれるさ","But the choice is ultimately yours.
Whatever you decide, the wind will
welcome you."
47,Suggest_Peninsula,"今のおすすめは… こっち側の道かな
乱気流になった気持ちで思い切り暴れてみなよ","I recommend...the route over here.
Today is a day to cast your fate to the
turbulent, capricious winds!"
48,Talk_00,ん どうしたんだい？,Hrm? What is wrong?
49,Talk_01,"今やめたところでルピーは返せないけど…
それでもいいのかい？","I have already used the rupees you
provided and cannot return them to you
now. Are you certain you want to quit?"
50,Talk_02,"はぁ…""臆病風に吹かれたみたいだね
キミにはガッカリだよ","*sigh* I am dismayed to see that the
fickle wind of cowardice has shaken
your resolve."
51,Talk_03,"ん そうかい
いつ飛んでも キミの自由だよ","I see. If you mean to fly, you may do so
whenever you like."
