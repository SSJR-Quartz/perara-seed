1,Talk_01,"こんな所までよく来たな
ここはゲルド族の氷室だ
砂漠で貴重な氷を切り出す
大切な場所なのだ","So you've found the Gerudo icehouse.
Long trek out here, huh?It's really the only place where we can
cut the ice we need. More precious than
diamonds, this stuff."
2,Talk_05,"コラ！氷室で火を焚くとは何事か！
氷が溶けてしまうだろ！出ていけ！","You! What's the idea, bringing that fire
into the icehouse?! Get out of here with
that! You're gonna ruin our supply!"
3,Talk_06,"おい！いい加減にしろ！氷が溶けたらどうする？！
出ていってくれ！","Hey! Enough of that!If that ice melts, you better believe you'll
be sorry! Get out!"
4,Talk_07,"オマエは～～！！これ以上氷室を荒らすな…
自分が抑えられなくなる……","YOU ARE SO DEAD!Go ahead, tear up the ice room... I won't be held
responsible for what happens next..."
5,Talk_08,火？！一体誰だ！！,Fire?! WHO DID THAT?!
6,Talk_09,"おい外で不審な者を
見かけなかったか？
突然氷室に火を放った曲者が
いたようでな…
見つけたらゲルド族の恐ろしさを
分からせてやらねば！","Hey. Did you see anyone suspicious
skulking around outside?

Some ruffian must have snuck in here
and played with fire while I was having
a rest. There was...some melting.
I HATE melting! If I ever find the culprit,
they will feel the wrath of a true Gerudo!"
