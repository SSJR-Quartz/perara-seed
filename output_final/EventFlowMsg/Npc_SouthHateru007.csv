7,BloodyMoon00,"赤い満月の深夜0時に空が血の色に染まる
それがブラッディムーンだ
その度に魔物たちは何度もよみがえり
倒しても倒しても きりがない…
今や誰も この現象を不思議に思わないようだが
私は研究を諦めないつもりだ","Whenever the clock strikes midnight on
unlucky nights, the sky turns blood red.
That's the blood moon.
When that happens, monsters come back
to life, no matter how many times you've
defeated them.
It's happened for so long now that no
one really pays it any mind, but I have no
plans to give up on my research."
8,BloodyTalk00,赤い…赤いぞーー！,"It's...so...RED!
So gloriously RED!"
9,BloodyTalk01,血が…血が騒ぐーー！,My blood...it's boiling!
10,BloodyTalk02,魔物よ よみがえれーー！,"Arise, monsters!"
11,BloodyTalk03,ガ… ガ… ガ…！,Gr...gr...gr...
12,FirstTalk00,む～ん…,Hmm...
13,FirstTalk01,"あっ失礼…

考え事をしていて気づかなかった
許してくれたまえ","Oh, sorry...


I didn't notice you... I was a bit lost in
thought there."
14,FirstTalk01_1,なんだね… キミは,What's up?
15,FirstTalk02,"私は あのブラッディムーン現象の謎を探るため
日夜研究に励んでいるのだ","I've been doing rigorous research day
and night to figure out the mystery of 
that blood moon."
16,FirstTalk03,"なんだ知らないのか？！

それは いけない
私の話を聞いていきたまえ","You don't know it?


That's inexcusable. Listen up and I'll tell
you about it."
17,FirstTalk04,"む～ん…
今知ったかぶりしなかったか？
まあいい
私の話を聞いてくれたまえ","Hmmm... Are you just pretending to
know what I was talking about?

That's fine, so long as you'll listen to me
now while I tell you about it."
18,FirstTalk05,"む～ん…
まあ そう言わずに話を聞いていきたまえ","Hmm...
All the same, take a minute and listen
while I tell you about it."
19,FirstTalk06,"大厄災の あの日以来…
月齢によらずに赤い満月が昇ることがあるのだ
そして深夜0時になると
空が血に染められたように真っ赤になり…
その瞬間から
倒したはずの魔物たちが よみがえる…","For 100 years now, every so often when
the clock strikes midnight, the sky turns
red and a full moon rises...
At that moment, monsters that had been
previously defeated will come back
to life."
20,FirstTalk07,それが血の満月なのだ！,"And that's what is known as the
blood moon!"
21,FirstTalk08,"なぜ魔物たちが復活するのか…
なぜ突然赤い満月の夜になるのか…
そんな事さえ解明されていない
まだまだ謎が多い現象なのだ
君もブラッディムーンについて何か分かったら
いつでも報告しに来てくれたまえ","Why do the monsters return to life? 
Why does it only happen when the sky
turns red?
No one really has the answers to those
questions. It's a mysterious
phenomenon...
If you learn anything about the blood
moon as you travel, be sure to come
back and tell me."
22,GoodBye00,"むーん…

あっ私としたことが…

月のことばかり考えているせいか
つい言ってしまうのです","Hmm...


Oh, I'm sorry...


I spend so much time thinking about the
moon that it's all I can talk about."
23,GoodBye01,むーん…,Hmm...
24,Moon00,"見たまえ！
いよいよブラッディムーンだ…","Tonight is the blood moon, at last..."
25,Moon00_After,"ブラッディムーンは終わってしまった…
また次に起きるのは いつだろうか…","The blood moon has come and gone.
Time to start waiting for the next one..."
26,Moon00_Befor,"この胸騒ぎ…
今夜は何かが起こりそうな気がする…","I'm getting that feeling again...
Something is going to happen tonight.
I can taste it!"
27,Moon00_Full,"今夜は満月…

今にも落ちてきそうな その豊満な丸み
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is a full moon...


Looks like it could come falling down any
minute. I can't take my eyes off of it."
28,Moon01,"今夜は十六夜…

昨日の満月からは少し欠けてしまったが
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight's moon will be a little smaller
than yesterday's full moon. It's nice in
its own way, really..."
29,Moon02,"今夜は下弦の月…

天のまた天を狙う弓 とでもいったところか
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is the third-quarter moon.
Like a bow aiming for the heavens above."

あの くびれたライン
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is the 26th-day moon...
Its sloping line is really wonderful."
31,Moon04,"今夜は新月…

見えないが そこにはある
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is a new moon...
Even though we can't see it, isn't it
great just knowing it's there?"
32,Moon05,"今夜は三日月…

何とも美味しそうな形
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is a crescent moon...
That shape makes me hungry for some
reason..."
33,Moon06,"今夜は上弦の月…

大地を狙う雄々しい弓 とでもいったところか
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is a seven-day moon...
Like a bow aiming for the land below,
it really is quite beautiful."
34,Moon07,"今夜は十三夜…

明日の満月に向けて もう満ちる事しかない
それもまた いいものだ…","Tonight is the 13th-day moon...
Now it will slowly expand. So beautiful..."

44,Rain01,雨宿りするから話は後だ！,"I'm taking cover from the rain!
We'll talk later!"
45,Rain02,雨で見られないのだよ！,Can't see anything in this rain!
46,Talk00,"ああ君か…

blood moon, as well?"
51,Talk04,"ああ…
今日は月が沈んでしまった…","Oh...
It looks like the moon has already
disappeared today..."
52,Talk05,他に聞きたいことは？,Anything else you want to ask?
53,Talk06,"何だい今夜の月の研究に備えて
今から寝るところなのだが…","What is it? I was just about to get some
sleep so I can be rested for researching
the moon tonight..."
54,Talk07,"何だい今夜の月の研究に備えて
寝てたのだが…","What is it? I was just sleeping so I'd be
well rested for researching the moon
tonight..."
