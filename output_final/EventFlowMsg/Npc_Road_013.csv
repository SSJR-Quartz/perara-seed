1,Atacked00,どうしたらいいの私たち…,What should we do...
2,Atacked01,魔物なんて どっか行けばいいのに…,I wish the monsters would just go away...
3,Failed00,冒険…キライになりそう…,"Adventure... I think I might just start
hating it..."
4,Failed01,"イタタタ…
なぜか魔物に襲われがちな私…","Ouchy... Why am I always attacked 
by monsters..."
5,Guardian00,"ガーディアンがこっちに…
逃げなきゃ…",A Guardian... I have to get out of here...
6,MSG_Firo_00,"なぜか魔物に襲われがちな私… 

馬宿の近くって魔物が多いですよね
怖いので一気に駆け抜けることにしまーす！","For some reason, I always seem to
attract monsters...

And it looks like there are a lot of
monsters near the stable too. My only
hope is to try and dash past them!"

stable. They're really scary, so I'm going
to try and just dash past them!"
8,MSG_Firo_01,"あなたと違って私は冒険初心者なので
無茶は絶対にしないんです
フィローネの森にあるという勇気の泉は
ご存知ですか？
何があるかわからないので…
私は行きません","Unlike you, I'm a newcomer to
adventuring! I don't want to push
myself too hard.
Speaking of adventuring, have you heard
of the Spring of Courage in the Faron
Woods?
I don't know anything about the area, so
I don't think I'll go there... Too risky for
a novice like me."
9,MSG_Firo_01_1,"フィローネの森にあるという勇気の泉は

何があるかわからないので…
私は行きません","Have you ever heard of the
Spring of Courage? It's supposed
to be in Faron Woods.
I have no idea what's in those woods,
though, so I'm definitely not going there."
10,MSG_Firo_02,"…ここから北西に たしかハイリア湖があって
その東側に フィローネの森があるはずです
実際には行かず地図で見ただけですけどね
私冒険家というより冒険ファンなので","...So Lake Hylia is northwest of here, and
then east of that should be the
Faron Woods.
I've never been there... I've only ever
seen the location on maps.

I suppose you could say I'm more of an
adventuring fan than an actual
adventurer..."

12,MSG_Firo_03,"私冒険家というより冒険ファン…

フィローネの森には古代遺跡が眠っています
行こうとは思いませんけど ロマンですよね！","I'm more of an adventuring fan than an
actual adventurer...

You know, there are ancient ruins hidden
away in Faron Woods. I would never go,
but overgrown ruins sound so...romantic!"

14,MSG_Firo_04,"ここレイクサイド馬宿から さらに東に向かうと
ウオトリー村という漁村があるんです
もちろん魔物も漏れなく襲ってきますよ","Starting from here at Lakeside Stable, if
you go further east, you'll come to a
fishing village called Lurelin Village.
Of course, it'd be awful if I left out the
part about how you'll definitely be
attacked by monsters along the way."

18,Near04,地図が濡れちゃう！,My map's gonna get wet!
19,Rest_00,"フィローネ街道の遺跡めぐりもやってみたいけど
なぜか魔物に襲われがちな私だから…","I would love to see all the ruins along the
Faron Highroad, but I seem to attract
monsters so easily..."
20,Rest_01,"私の場合は ライト感覚の冒険だから
雨天中止なんですー","My approach to adventuring is much
more casual than most... For example,
I take a break whenever it's raining out."
21,Rest_02,"蚊に刺されやすい人っていますよね？
私の場合は魔物に襲われがちな人…","You know how some people just seem to
attract mosquitoes? Well, that's how I am
with monsters, it seems..."
22,RetMSG_Firo_00,"なぜか魔物に襲われがちな私… 

高原の馬宿の近くで襲ってきた魔物は
今でも夢で見るほど恐ろしいやつらでした！","For some reason, I always seem to
attract monsters...

The monsters that attacked me near 
the Highland Stable were so scary, I still
see them in my dreams sometimes!"

24,RetMSG_Firo_01,"フィローネの森は複雑だけど
地図をよく見て歩けば安心ですよ
私なんかは森に行かず地図だけ眺めてるので
もっと安心なんですけどね","The Faron Woods are a little tricky, but
as long as you keep one eye on your
map, you should be OK.
As for me, I'll just look at the map and
stay put. Can't get much safer than that!"
25,RetMSG_Firo_01_1,"フィローネの森は複雑だけど

map close at hand, you should be fine!"
26,RetMSG_Firo_02,"フィローネの森は うっそうとした森林地帯で…
そこには龍の口と呼ばれる湖があるそうです
冒険家の方から聞いた情報なんですけど
誰かに話したくて ウズウズしてたんですよ","Faron Woods is really, really thick.
I've also heard of a lake there called...
\""Mouth of the Dragon\"" or something...
I heard this tidbit from another
adventurer, and I just couldn't wait to
share it!"

28,RetMSG_Firo_03,"冒険は初心者の私ですが
馬宿で いろいろな冒険家の話を聞きました
フロリア湖には数多くの滝があるそうです
私…滝の裏側が大好きなんです","I'm still a novice when it comes to 
adventuring, but I do hear lots of stories 
from adventurers at the stable.
Like...Lake Floria has several waterfalls
in the area! You know...I've always liked
the idea of going behind a waterfall."

adventure?"
34,SavedLv2_00,"怖かった…
でも あなたがいてくれてよかった…","That was really scary...
I'm glad you were around."
35,SavedLv2_01,"ああ怖かった…
でも もう大丈夫でしょ？","Oh, that was scary... But everything is
gonna be all right now, right?"
36,SavedLv3_00,"助かったの？助かったのね？！
どうもありがとう！","I'm alive?! I'm alive! And you saved me?
Thank you so much!"
