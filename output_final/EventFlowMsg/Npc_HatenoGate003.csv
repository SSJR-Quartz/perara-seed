7,Talk01,"見れば見るほど
大厄災の凄まじさが伝わってくるよな
それにしても
このガーディアンの数 すごくないか？
それだけその剣士様が
大厄災にとって脅威だったって事なんだろうな","The more I see of this place, the more
it hits me just how hard the old tragedy
struck here.But even knowing that, seeing so many
Guardians... It boggles the mind.That warrior must have been some threat
to the forces of darkness, huh?"
8,Talk04,"こんなガーディアンの大群を
よくここで せき止められたよな
このハテノ砦と剣士様がいなかったら
少なくともハテノ村は壊滅してたって話だぜ","Almost hard to believe they managed to
hold back a whole horde of Guardians
here.
If not for Fort Hateno and the warrior,
there'd be no such place as
Hateno Village anymore."
9,Talk06,"……

ハテノ砦や剣士様について
もっと語り合いたいところだが…
俺はガーディアンとの戦いで命を落とした
剣士様や兵士達のための黙とうに集中したいんだ
夜が明けたら語り合おうぜ","I'd love to keep jawing with you about
Fort Hateno and the warrior—don't get
me wrong.But I'm observing a moment of silence
for the warrior and his troops who fought
to the last against the Guardians.
We can pick it up again in the morning."
10,Talk08,"大厄災ってさ…自分には
関係ないことだって思ってたけどさ
命を懸けて戦ってくれた人達がいるから
自分たちは平和に過ごせてるんだよな…
って…雨のせいかな
ちょっと しんみりしちゃったぜ","I used to think the old tragedy was
ancient history. Nothing to do with
my life.But when I stop to consider that my
life is only possible because of those
who fought tooth and nail for us...
Well, I start to feel a tear in my eye.
Although that could also just be the rain."
11,Talk12,"おっ チィッス！

俺の名はプリトスってんだ
アンタもハテノ砦を見に来たくち？","Hiya! My name's Garill. Come to see
Fort Hateno, I take it?"
12,Talk13,"寝てない…

寝てないぜ！

俺はこのハテノ砦で亡くなった
剣士様や兵士達の魂に祈りを捧げてんだ…
絶対寝てないぜ！

なんならアンタも一緒にどうだい？","I wasn't sleeping... I wasn't!I was praying for the souls of the warrior
and all who died here at Fort Hateno.
That's a totally different thing!
You're welcome to join me if you want.
"
13,Talk14,"そうだよな！
だと思ったぜ！
このハテノ砦は大厄災から
ハテノ村を守った最後の砦！
男なら一度は見ておかないと！だよな！","Figured as much. It's well worth seeing!Fort Hateno here was the last line of
defense between Hateno Village and the
awful tragedy all those years ago.
Everyone's got to come and pay their
respects at least once in life, right?"
14,Talk15,"えっ？
話しかけといてスルーとか あり得ないだろ？
このハテノ砦は大厄災から
ハテノ村を守った最後の砦なんだ
アンタもハイリア人なら
しっかり勉強しないと！ だぜ！","You come up to talk to me and then
give me the brush-off? What gives?Listen, Fort Hateno here was the last line
of defense between Hateno Village and
the tragedy all those years ago.
You're a Hylian—you ought to know 
these things! Have some respect!
Learn some history!"
15,Talk16,"まぁ無理強いはしないけどさ

このハテノ砦は大厄災から
ハテノ村を守った最後の砦
ここがなかったら
今のハテノ村は ないかもしれないんだぜ？
亡くなった人達の冥福を祈り
その勇姿を語り継いでいくのが
今を生きる俺達のなすべきこと！だと思うぜ！","I don't mean to pressure you. But
Fort Hateno here was the last line of
defense for Hateno all those years ago.
If not for this fort and the soldiers who
held the line here, Hateno Village as we
know it might be gone entirely.
I hang around to pray that those who
gave their lives find peace and to pass
on the story of the hero.
I owe that much to the soldiers who
fought so that we might live today!
I think everyone does."
16,Talk17,"へぇ まだ若いってのに
殊勝な事を言うじゃないか！
このハテノ砦は大厄災から
ハテノ村を守った最後の砦
ここがなかったら
今のハテノ村はないかもしれないからな
俺達は亡くなった人達の冥福を祈り
その勇姿を語り継いでいかないとな","That's a pretty enlightened thing to say
for such a young kid!Fort Hateno here was the last line of
defense between Hateno Village and the
terrible tragedy all those years ago.
If not for this fort and the soldiers who
held the line here, Hyrule as we know it
might be gone entirely.
It's our duty as the survivors to pray that
those who gave their lives find peace
and to pass on the story of the warrior."
17,Talk18,"知ってる？
このハテノ砦で戦った剣士様の話？","Do you know the story of the warrior
who fought here at Fort Hateno?"
18,Talk19,"100年前は英傑って呼ばれる
特別な人達がいたらしくてさ
ここで戦った剣士様も
その英傑の一人だったそうだぜ
他の英傑達はみんな大厄災で
命を落としたって聞いてるけどさ
剣士様だけは
ここで命を落としたって説もあれば
来たるべき時に備え
眠りについたって説もあるんだってよ
もし眠りについたってなら
まだ生きてるってことだよな？
この時代に目が覚めてくんね～かなぁ
そしたら絶対会いに行くんだけどな","So 100 years ago, we had these
special warriors called Champions.The warrior who fought here was
supposedly one of them. I heard the
others all died in the big fight.
The warrior, though... Some say he gave
his life here too.But others think he went into a deep
sleep to prepare to fight another day.
Which would mean he's still alive, right?
I wonder if I'll still be around when he
wakes up. I'd love to meet the guy."
19,Talk20,"おっ やるじゃん！

じゃあさ剣士様は
ここで命を落としたって説もあれば
来たるべき時に備え
眠りについたって説があるのも知ってる？
もし眠りについたってなら
まだ生きてるってことだよな？
この時代に目が覚めてくんね～かなぁ
そしたら絶対会いに行くんだけどな","Oh, that's excellent! Saves me the
trouble of having to tell you.You know, most people think the warrior
gave his life here in battle with the
forces of darkness.
But some believe he actually went into a
deep sleep, so he could live again to
fight another day!
If that's true, he must still be alive.
I wonder if I'll still be around when he
wakes up... I'd love to meet the guy."
20,Talk21,"剣士様やハテノ砦の兵士達が
命を懸けて この世界を守ってくれたって事
今を生きている俺らが
後世の人達に伝えていかないと！ だぜ！","The warrior and his soldiers at
Fort Hateno risked their lives to
protect the world.I wasn't there at the time, but I'm alive
now because of them, and I've got to
make sure future generations know it!"
21,Talk22,"俺も 100年前に生まれてたら

ここで剣士様と一緒に 
ガーディアンと戦ったのになぁ","If I'd been alive 100 years ago...I like
to think I'd have fought these Guardians
here, right at the warrior's side."
