9,Talk_09,"……

ちょっ… ちょっと アンタ誰よ！
こんな時間に レディーの部屋に来るなんて…
……あれ？

それってシーカーストーンじゃない？

まさかアナタが おばあちゃんが言ってた
大厄災の… あの剣士様ってこと？
へぇ～
もっとおじいちゃんかと思ってた…
まぁ私達みたいな若者にとっては
大厄災って言われても ピンとこないんだけど…
…って そのぽかんとした顔
もしかして アナタもピンときてないの？","...


HEY! How could you BE so rude!
Bothering a lady in her room!
And AT NIGHT of all times!
...
...
...Huh?
Isn't that...a Sheikah Slate?


Are you the hero Grandmother told me
about? The legendary swordsman...
of the Great Calamity?
WOW! I figured you'd be all old and
wrinkly by now. But you SO are not...

Young people like me have a hard time
wrapping our heads around something
like the Great Calamity.
Huh... Judging by the look on your face,
I dare say you're having a hard time
with it too."
10,Talk_10,"ああ お兄さん
遊びにきてくれたの？
私ね夜のこの時間が大好きだったんだ…

夜はね色んなものが光っていて
キラキラして きれいなの
ホタルなんかも あちこちにいたんだけど
そっと近づいて捕まえるのが意外と難しくてね
気が付いたら朝 なんてこともあって
おばあちゃんに よく叱られたっけな…
でも最近は村の近くにまで魔物が出てきたり
イーガ団が出るって噂まであって…
で…仕方なくお家で ゴロゴロしてるってわけ
あ～ なんか面白いことないかなぁ…","Oh! You're paying me a visit?
That's sweet of you.

Ya know, I used to really love the night.
At night the world sparkles and shines
in an almost magical way. It's beautiful.
Oh, and fireflies are everywhere!
Though trying to sneak up on and
catch them is quite a challenge.
There were times when I'd stay out so
late, I didn't realize morning had come.
Grandmother always scolded me for that.
But that's all in the past. Now there are
monsters around the village and rumors
that the Yiga Clan is nearby and active...
That's why I'm forced to lounge around
at home instead of chasing the night.
*sigh* I wish I could do something..."
11,Talk_11,"ホタル きれいだったなぁ…
また見られるなんて思ってなかったよ…
ありがとね剣士様","The fireflies were so pretty...
I didn't think I'd ever see them again.
Thank you, Mr. Hero."
12,Talk_12,"なんだろう…ホタルがいるってだけで
すっごく やさしい気持ちになるよね","I don't know why, but seeing fireflies
always warms my heart..."
13,Talk_13,"やだ もうこんなに暗くなっちゃった！
早く帰らないと おばあちゃんに叱られちゃう！","Oh, my! It's already so dark!
I've gotta get back home right away,
or Grandmother will scold me!"
14,Talk_14,"ああ…今日もホタル きれいだったなぁ…

この村では ホタルは一年中見られるんだけど
捕まえるのが なかなか難しくてね…
子供のころは簡単だったのになぁ…","Wow, the fireflies were gorgeous today.
I love that you can see them all year
long in this village.
But...they're really hard to catch.
I was pretty good at it when I was
a kid, though."
15,Talk_15,"昔はよく夜に
ホタルをとりに行ったんだ
あの子達って すぐ逃げちゃうから
そっと近づかないといけないんだけど
それが楽しくって…

でも最近は村の近くにまで魔物が出てきたり
イーガ団が出るって噂まであって…
夜は外に出るなって言われてるんだ
あ～ なんか面白いことないかなぁ…","I used to go out at night to catch
fireflies. They fly away quickly, so you 
have to sneak up on them slowly.
It's more than fun...it's magical.


But that's all in the past. Now there are
monsters around the village and rumors
that the Yiga Clan is nearby and active...
That's why I'm forced to stay inside
when it's dark instead of chasing the
night. *sigh* I wish I could do something."
16,Talk_16,"ホタルを見てから朝も元気いっぱいだよ！

今日も お店の呼び込み がんばるんだ！
剣士様も また来てね！","I saw some fireflies fireflying around,
so now I'm in a good mood and ready
to face the day!
I'm gonna do my best to get lots of
customers today! Promise to come
back again soon, Mr. Hero!"
17,Talk_20,"売り物は なくなっちゃったけど…

美人のクラリちゃんが
いつでもアナタを お出迎え！
よかったら寄ってってね！！","We've sold through all of our stock... 


But don't worry! The lovely Claree
is always happy to greet you.
See for yourself!"
18,Talk_21,おはよー！,Good morniiing!
19,Talk_23,"お家で ホタルが見られるなんて！
剣士様には本当に感謝だよ！
クラリに見せてあげたいな～","I can't believe it! I can see fireflies right
outside my house! Life doesn't get any
better than this.
I really owe you one... Oh! Oh!
I bet Claree would like a picture
of this!"
20,Talk_25,"雨宿りだけでも いいですよ！
呉服屋忍杏亭はこちら…
…って やだっ！
お兄さんって私の好みのタイプ～！","We're open rain or shine!
Enchanted, right this...
right this way...
Oh, my... What's this? Look at that face!
You are TOTALLY my type. Hi."
21,Talk_26,"…ウ ウソでしょ…？

でも まぁ…私は よくわかんないけど
剣士様には使命ってのあるんでしょ？
ウチは呉服屋やってんだけど
身支度が必要なら いつでも寄ってってよ","You must be kidding me...


I don't...know about that kind of stuff.
But I'm pretty sure the hero of legend
is on...like, a quest or something?
I'm, uh, running a clothing shop here...
so stop by if you're looking for
something cute to wear."
22,Talk_27,"…ウ ウソでしょ…？

じゃあインパ様の所にでも行ってきたら？
アナタの知りたいこと教えてくれると思うよ","...Are you kidding me?


Um, you should go see Lady Impa.
She seems like she would know about
that kind of thing."
23,Talk_28,けっこう降ってきちゃったね～,"Wow, it's really coming down!"
24,Talk_29,"今日は あいにくのお天気だね！

これから クラリんとこ行くんだけど
