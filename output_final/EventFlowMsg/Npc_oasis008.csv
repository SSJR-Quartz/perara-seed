3,Near_00,あのね…,Listen to this...
4,Near_03,うい～,Heeeeehee...
5,Talk_01,"まったく… ゲルド族の神器を
賊に奪われるなんてね…","Good grief... I can't believe the chief's
heirloom was stolen by thieves..."
6,Talk_02,"ウルボザ様が愛用されてたって言われてる
兜でしょ？
代々ゲルドの王家に伝わってきたものだし
族長様も かなり肩を落とされているらしいわ","Oh, the helmet that was supposed to be
Lady Urbosa's favorite, right?

It's been handed down from chief to
chief for generations. Apparently the
chief is pretty distressed."
7,Talk_03,"ねぇ聞いた？
神器が戻ってきたんだって！","Hey, have you heard? Apparently the
chief's heirloom has been returned!"
8,Talk_04,"まだ小さいのに…
お可哀そうに…","She's still so small, too... Poor thing..."
9,Talk_05,"犯人の目星は ついてるらしいんだけど
なかなか手ごわい相手らしいわ
なんでも プロの暗殺者集団とかなんとか…","They have an idea of who committed the
theft, but the thieves aren't amateurs...
I heard they're professional assassins."
10,Talk_06,"だから兵舎が
いつも以上に ざわついているのね…","That explains why the barracks have
been noisier than usual."
11,Talk_07,"聞いた聞いた！

なんでも ハイリア人の
すっごい ヴァーイがいたとか？
これで族長様も肩の荷がおりたんじゃない？","I heard, I heard!
Something about an amazing Hylian
vai, right?
That's got to take a lot of weight off
the chief's shoulders, huh?"
12,Talk_08,"でもまた賊が来るかもしれないってことで
しばらくは まだ警戒態勢みたいだけどね～","But there's still a chance that the thieves
will come back here, so we've got to
keep vigilant for a while, right?"
13,Talk_09,"そういえば あの神獣
おとなしくなったわね…","Speaking of which, the Divine Beast
has gotten quiet, huh?"
14,Talk_10,そういえば…最近地震ないかも…,"Now that you mention it, I haven't
noticed any rocking or shaking at all..."
15,Talk_11,"神器が戻ってきたことと
何か関係あるのかな？","I wonder if this has something to do with
the chief's heirloom being returned..."
16,Talk_12,"まだ お酒を飲むには
早い気がするけど…アナタいくつなの？","You definitely don't look old
enough to drink here yet...
How old are you, really?"
17,Talk_13,"……

あっはっは！

アナタ面白いヴァーイね！
大人になったら一緒に飲みましょうよ！
その時は お姉さんが
おごってあげるわよ～","...


AH HA HA!
What a funny vai you are! When you're
older, let's have a drink together!"
18,Talk_14,お酒は大人になってから… よ！,"These drinks are for adults, got it?"
19,Talk_15,"砂漠の夜は冷えるでしょ？

この街は大丈夫だけどその恰好じゃ
夜に外に出たら風邪ひくどころじゃないよ
防寒着持ってないなら
ホテルで朝まで休んでった方がいいかもね","The desert gets pretty cold at night,
you know...

You'll be fine dressed like that in town,
but if you go outside the walls, you'll
catch a cold or worse, for sure!
If you don't have a warm doublet, you'd
better rest at a hotel until morning."
20,Talk_16,"あれ～ アナタ誰だっけ～？

んふふ～知ってるかもしれないけど
知らないかもしれないし～忘れちゃった～
ちょっと酔っ払っちゃったけど
今日も楽しいお酒だったな～
明日も飲まなきゃ～","Oh? Who are you again? I might well
know you, but then again... Maybe not!

I've had fun drinking today, too!
I've got to do this again tomorrow!"
21,Talk_17,き…気持ち悪い…,Urk...I don't feel so good...
22,Talk_18,"ごめんよ今はそっとしておいてくれる？
頭が痛くってね…
飲みすぎたかな…","Sorry, but can you please keep it down?
I've got an awful headache..."
23,Talk_19,"毎日 ネリッシュとおしゃべりしてるけど
些細なことや同じ話題でも
ヴァーイ友達とだったら
いくらで話せちゃうのよね…","Nali and I chat every day, but we never
tire of talking about the same things.

When I'm with my vai friends, I feel like
we could talk forever."
