47,talk00,誰？,Who are you?
48,talk01,…さようなら,Good-bye.
49,talk02,あなた…よく見たらヴォーイじゃない,"You...you're a voe, aren't you?"
50,talk03,何？,What?
51,talk04,用が無いなら話しかけないで,"Don't bother me if you have nothing to
say."
52,talk05,"う～ん…きゃしゃなヴォーイは
ママは許してくれなそうだな
あ ごめんなさい

私は パウダ
ゲルドの街から来たの","Hmm... No. I bet Mama would have a
problem with a delicate voe like you.

Oh, yes, I'm Rhondson. I hail from
Gerudo Town."
53,talk06,"あぁ… あなたみたいな
ハイリア人には関係無い話だけど…
ゲルドの民は私くらいの歳になると
周りがうるさくてね","Ugh... I don't know why I'm even saying
this—it's no business of a Hylian like
you, but...
I'm constantly being bothered by my
mother over not having found the love
of my life..."
54,talk07,"…知らない？

ゲルドの民が適齢期になると
街を出て婿を探す風習…
いわゆる 「ヴォーイ・ハント」ね","You don't know? Really?


It's incredibly rare for a male to be born
to the Gerudo. For our own survival as a
people, we travel to find husbands..."
55,talk08,"そう「ヴォーイ・ハント」

ゲルドの民は適齢期になると
街を出て婿を探さなくてはいけない アレ","Exactly. Since it's so rare for a voe to be
born to a Gerudo, we seek out husbands
from the world beyond Gerudo Town."
56,talk09,"私 こう見えても
お料理 お習字 お裁縫…
一通りの教養は あるつもりなんだけど
この辺のヴォーイは求めてないみたい","I've proven myself to be a gifted tailor,
but none of the voe I've met seem to
appreciate a well-hemmed garment.
I was hoping my craft would help me find
a mate, but it doesn't seem like there's
much work for a tailor around here."
57,talk10,"はぁ…どこかに私に似つかわしい
ヴォーイは居ないかしら？","I wonder if there really is someone out
there for me..."
58,talk11,"はぁ…どこかに私に似つかわしい
ヴォーイは居ないかしら？","I wonder if there really is someone out
there for me..."
59,talk12,"イチカラ村の…エノキダ
って人が作業着を繕って欲しいの？
それくらい お安い御用だけど
アッカレ地方は ちょっと遠いわね
でも ここに居てもラチが明かないし
そのイチカラ村とやらで ヴォーイ・ハントかな…","Hudson in Tarrey Town needs
a tailor? It's something, I suppose...

The Akkala region is kinda far away.
But maybe I need to travel. Getting far
away from a village full of vai...
But it's not like I'm accomplishing
anything by staying here. I can continue
my search in Tarrey Town..."
60,talk13,…サヴォッタ,Sav'otta.
61,talk14,…サヴァーク,Sav'aaq.
62,talk15,…サヴァサーバ,Sav'saaba.
63,talk16,…ふぅ,*sigh*
64,talk17,"私は今日も ヴォーイ・ハントよ

お料理 お習字 お裁縫…
バッチリなつもりなんだけど…","I'm still considering how to continue my
search. I've mastered tailoring... I have
dozens of other skills...
I just don't understand what voe are
looking for..."
65,talk18,うん…,Yeah...
66,talk19,"それにしても こんなしきたり…
もうウンザリ","This search for the love of my life...
I'm so exhausted by it."
67,talk20,ヴァーサーク私に用かしら？,Vasaaq! Did you need me for something?
68,talk21,"あら？ゲルドの民族衣装…
懐かしいわ","Oh? Traditional Gerudo clothing...
How nostalgic."
69,talk22,どれを売ってくれるのかしら？,What would you like to sell?
70,talk23,サヴォークまた来てね,Sav'orq. Come back soon.
71,talk24,"私の事覚えてる？
パウダよ","Heehee... Don't you remember me?
I'm Rhondson!"
72,talk25,"エノキダの作業着なら
毎日のように繕ってるわ
それにしても エノキダの作業着…
汗臭くて やんなっちゃう
彼と話しても つっけんどんだし…
本当 つまらないヴォーイね
せっかくここまで ヴォーイ・ハントに来たのに
あんなのしか居ないのかしら…","I've had to mend Hudson's work
clothes every single day. It's impressive
how quickly he wears them down...
Besides the holes... They reek so much
of sweat, it's...actually pretty rough to
work on them.
I tried to bring it up to him, but he got
defensive almost immediately.

You know, I came out here to continue
my search for a husband... I wonder if
he's the only kind of voe I'll find..."
73,talk26,"あら全部買ってくれたのね
サークサーク","Oh! You bought everything!
Sarqso."
74,talk28,"私の手作り防具
ゆっくり見てってちょうだいね","Please take your time looking. This
armor was all handmade, by the way."
75,talk29,"今は「サヴォッタ」よ？
ふふ…","You should say \""sav'otta\"" now!
Heehee..."
76,talk30,"そうね""今の時間はサヴァークね","Yes, \""sav'aaq\""! That is correct!
Heehee..."
77,talk31,"今は「サヴァサーバ」よ？
ふふ…","You should say \""sav'saaba\"" now!
Heehee..."
78,talk32,"ここに来てから毎日のように
エノキダの作業着を繕ってるわ
そう言えば エノキダが
岩を壊してる時に出てきた宝石を くれたわ
案外 いい人なのかも知れない…
ぶっきらぼうだけど","I've had to mend Hudson's work
clothes every single day. It's impressive
how quickly he wears them down...
Speaking of which, Hudson gave me
a gem he found after breaking a rock.

He may actually be a good person...
Though he is quite direct."
79,talk34,"そうそう知ってるかも知れないけど

私…エノキダと婚約したの","Oh, maybe you've already heard, but...
Hudson and I are engaged!"
80,talk35,"列席してくれてありがとうね

これからも夫婦共々 よろしくね","Thank you so much for coming! And
thank you for helping me honor
Gerudo tradition...
I hope you'll continue to support both
of us!"
81,talk36,"あれからエノキダとは
なんだかんだで うまくやってるわ
いつでも遊びに来てちょうだいね","Since the wedding, Hudson and I
have been getting along pretty well.
Come back and visit us anytime!"
82,talk37,"情報ありがとう
一旦お家で大きな荷物取ってくるわね
じゃイチカラ村で会いましょう","Thanks for all the information. I'm gonna
go home and pack a huge bag. It'll be a
long journey all the way there...
I'll no doubt see you again in
Tarrey Town."
83,talk39,ふふ…びっくりした？,Heehee... Were you surprised?
84,talk40,ふふ…ありがとう,Heehee... Sarqso.
85,talk41,"エノキダって働く事以外能が無いけど
ま それもいいかな？って
詳しくはエノキダに聞いてみて","Hudson isn't all that great at things
besides his chosen profession, but...
I guess that isn't a huge deal, is it?
You should talk to him if you want
to know more."
86,talk42,"挙式なんだけど…
あなたも列席してくれるかしら？","We're holding a ceremony...
I was wondering if you'd like to attend?"
87,talk43,"サークサーク！

でも今は神父を探してる所なの

衣装は無くても何とかなるけど…

神父役を グレーダ君やペーダ君に
やってもらうワケには…ねぇ","Sarqso. We're actually actively looking
for a priest right now.

Getting the proper clothes to wear isn't
a problem at all, but...

It's not like we can ask Greyson or
Fyson to preside for us."
88,talk44,あら そう…,"Oh, I see..."
89,talk45,"とりあえず神父がカポーダさんに
決まってよかったわ
なので今まさに式の準備にかかってて
こう見えて私もエノキダも ちょっと忙しいのよ
エノキダの上司も呼ばなきゃだし
息が詰まりそう…","For now, I'm glad we decided to have
Kapson preside over the ceremony.

We're in the middle of preparing,
actually. Both Hudson and I are
pretty busy.
We've got to invite Hudson's boss,
too..."
90,talk46,"エノキダの上司と後輩を
呼んで来てくれたのね","You went and called on Hudson's
boss and coworker for us?"
91,talk47,"でも今の時間は
お二人とも お休みでしょうし…
式は明るい時に始めたいから
その時エノキダに話してくれる？","But right now those two are probably
taking a break...

I'd like the ceremony to start when it's
bright outside, so when the time comes,
can you talk to Hudson for me?"
92,talk48,"今日は式を始めるには打ってつけだわ

エノキダに話して式を始めましょう","Today's the ideal day to start the
ceremony.

Talk to Hudson, and let's get it started!"
93,talk49,すぅ…すぅ…,*snoooooze*
94,talk50,"可愛いヴァーイね
あなたも ヴォーイ・ハント？","What a cute vai.
Are you out seeking the love of your
life, as well?"
95,talk51,お互い頑張りましょうね,"Well, good luck to both of us!"
96,talk52,あら そう…,"Oh, I see..."
97,talk53,あれ…聞き間違いかしら？,Huh... Not the answer I expected...
98,talk54,"ヴァーイ…
あなたも ヴォーイ・ハント？","Vai...
Are you seeking out the love of your
life, as well?"
99,talk55,"この娘…暑さにやられて
言ってる事が無茶苦茶だわ…","This poor girl... I wonder if she even has a plan
for a life beyond our home..."
100,talk56,"え…なになに？藪から棒に…
詳しく聞かせて","Eh? What is it? So abrupt, too...
Let me hear the details."
101,talk57,"そこから下りてくれないかしら？
子供じゃあるまいし","Hey, can you please get down?
You aren't a child anymore, you know."
102,talk58,"机に乗るのは やめた方がいいわ
育ちが分かるわよ？","You should really quit climbing on tables
like that. It doesn't reflect well on your
upbringing at all..."
103,talk59,"机に乗るなんて…
やっていい事と悪い事があるわ","I can't believe you climbed up there...
You know there are certain things you
just shouldn't do, right?"
104,talk60,"机に乗っちゃダメよ
小さい頃教えてもらわなかった？","Don't climb up on tables. Didn't anyone
ever teach you how rude that is?"
105,talk61,"結婚式…ドタバタだったけど
無事に終わってよかったわ
あのドレス""私の手作りなの

でも エノキダのくれた宝石を散りばめたら
重くなっちゃって参ったわ…
まぁ長い人生 いろいろあると思うけれど
今後ともよろしくね","The wedding ceremony...wasn't what I
expected, but it was special all the same.

Did you like the dress? I made it myself.


Although Hudson wanted me to weave
the gems he mined into it, so every step
down the aisle was a struggle.
Well, that's life for you, with all its twists
and turns. I hope you'll stick with us
through them."
