ご利益もとめて遠くから観光客が来るのさ～
にいさんも行ってみたらどうさね？","Huh? You haven't heard? There's a
special place where they say you can
find your true love.
Folks come from all over to visit, hoping
for love. It's the Lover's Pond on
Tuft Mountain.
Why don't you go check it out, mister?"
12,talk02,"あれあれ そうかいさ～
最近 この村にも観光客が多いさ～ね
目的は恋が成就する最強パワースポット
そこのカール山にあるラブポンドさ～
まあ にいさん もてそうだもんな～
行く必要ないわさ～ね","I see, I see. There've been lots of visitors
to this village lately.

They come seeking the special place
where it's said true love can be found...
Lover's Pond on Tuft Mountain.
But you look like you're probably already
popular with the ladies, so maybe that's
not where you're headed."
13,talk03,むにゃむにゃ,Mmm...mmm...
14,talk04,"そういや つい最近にも
カール山に登っていった人がいたさ～
恋は成就したかいね～？","Oh, yeah, there have been

I wonder if they found love there..."

最近賭け事に はまりすぎて
すっからかんなのさ～
にいさん100ルピーほど預けてくれんかいさ？
勝ったら10倍にして返すのさ～","The ol' war chest has seen better days...


See, I've gotten really into gambling
lately, but the gambling hasn't gotten
really into me, if you get my meaning.
I don't suppose you could spot me...
say, 100 rupees, could you? Once I hit it
big, I'll repay you 10 times over!"
17,talk09,"残念なのさ～
誰か他の人から借りるわいさ～","That's...unfortunate.
Guess I'll just have to find someone else
to give me a hand, huh..."
18,talk10,"あれあれ にいさん
この前は助かったわいさ～
でも また
すっからかんに なってしまったのさ～
また100ルピーほど預けてくれんかいさ？
勝ったら10倍にして返すのさ～","Hey, it's my friend! Thanks for helping
me out before—I really appreciate it.

Thing is, though... I'm flat broke again.


What do you say to spotting me some
more rupees? I think 100 rupees would
be enough. You know I'm good for it!
You know I'll pay ya back 10 times over!"
19,talk11,"おいおい にいさん！
そんなに急かさないで～
賭けの結果は
また明日以降に聞きに来るわいさ～","Whoa there, buddy!
No need to rush me!

I won't know the outcome of the bet
until tomorrow, so you should come
back then."

大儲け！
にいさんのおかげなのさ～
約束通り10倍にして返すわいさ～","My buddy! My pal! I won!
I hit the jackpot!

It's all thanks to you, too!
Just like I promised, here's your share:
10 times what you lent me!"
21,talk13,"負けちまったよ にいさん…
また すっからかんなのさ～","I... I lost, buddy.
I'm broke as broke can be."
22,talk14,"これだから賭けは やめられないさ～ね
にいさんも一度やってみると いいのさ～","But I can't give up now.
You'd understand in my shoes.
You should give it a shot!"
23,talk15,ありがたく預かるわいさ～,"Ah, thanks. I'm most grateful."
24,talk16,"これを元手に
稼いでくるさ～期待するのさ～
結果は また明日以降に
聞きにくるわいさ～","I'm gonna go use this to make us some
money. Don't you worry.

Come back after tomorrow to hear
how it went."
25,talk17,"おいおい ルピー足りないじゃないか
がっかりなのさ～","Hold on, you don't have enough to lend

預かったルピーは返せないけど
それでも いいかいさ？","Just so we're clear, though... If my luck
fails me, I won't be able to pay you back.
You're OK with that?"
