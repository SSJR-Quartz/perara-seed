1,Talk01,"美しい海と その海とともに暮らす人々
絶景という言葉でも まだ足りないな……","The gorgeous ocean and those who live
in harmony with it... Words alone can't
describe such exquisite scenery."
2,Talk03,"おや？ これはハイラル城……
大厄災が起こる前の風景みたいだな
城の中心部というよりは周辺の回廊のようだが
絵としては イマイチな構図だな……","Hm? Oh, yes, this is Hyrule Castle.
It appears to be a view of it from
before the Great Calamity.
Rather than the castle, it focuses on the
surrounding cloisters. What a fascinating
composition for a picture..."
3,Talk05,"この絵を残した者は いったい何を
伝えたかったのだろうか……？","Whoever left this picture behind...
I feel like they were trying to convey
something special to the viewer."
