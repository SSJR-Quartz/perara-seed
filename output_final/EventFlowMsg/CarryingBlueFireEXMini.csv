really just the same as a regular flame.

Ah, it's not just a pretty girl in these
images. Yes, there are also some old
landscape photos stored in the album.
I knew Princess Zelda had made frequent
use of the Camera feature, but this...

Hey, Linky! It dawns on me that you were
Princess Zelda's appointed knight, which
means...
there's a strong possibility that you
accompanied her to all of the places
where these pictures were taken.
Oh...right. The \""lost memory\"" thing
could prove troublesome.

But don't lose hope! It just means these
pictures could be the missing piece
to help restore your lost memories!

check in with Impa. She knows more
about Princess Zelda than even I do!"
