1,talk00,"お？あんた ウチの馬宿に泊ってくのかい？
この際あんたも話を聞いてくれよ
ここからしばらく南に行くと
ワシュアの丘という丘がある
そこに得体のしれない謎の台座があるんだが…
それが何なのか さっぱりわからねぇんだよ
あぁ ゴーグの兄貴も オレも いつになったら
謎を解き明かせることやら……","You stayin' here at our stable?
That's nice, but check this out.

Go way out south of here, and you'll 
find a flat hill called Washa's Bluff.

On that hill, there's this mysterious-
lookin' platform thingie...

Me and Geggle tried all day to figure out
what it does, but we're stumped..."
2,talk01,"謎の台座を見てみたいなら
ずっと南にあるワシュアの丘に行ってみな","If you want to see the platform thingie, 
go south toward Washa's Bluff."
3,talk02,"え？何？古代の祠が出てきた？！
あの台座には そんな謎があったのか！
よし！今度はその祠の謎を解かねぇとな！","Huh?! An ancient shrine thingie
appeared? Who'da thunk that platform
thingie was hidin' a mystery like that!
I guess that means I have to solve the
mystery of the shrine thingie now."
4,talk03,"今度は古代の祠……
謎は深まるばかりだぜ……","Ancient shrine...
The mystery deepens..."
5,talk04,"あ～ぁ シロヤギの面倒なんか
見てる場合じゃ ねぇんだけどなぁ……","Oooh, I don't have time to be lookin'
after mountain goats right now..."
6,talk05,"あ～ぁ こんなところで
飲んでる場合じゃ ねぇんだけどなぁ……","Oooh, I don't have time to be drinkin'
right now..."
7,talk06,"そういえば この話を聞いて南の方に
飛んで行ったリト族の野郎がいたな
でっかい楽器を持った吟遊詩人だ
きっと台座を見に行ったに違いねぇ","There was this one...Rito guy that went
flying to the south after I told him about
it.
He was a big ol' bard with some fancy
instrument thingie. He probably wanted
to see the altar thingie himself."
