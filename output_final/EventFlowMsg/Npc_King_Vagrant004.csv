お主… どうして それを…？

…いや それより
そのレシピは…？","Wait... Is that...


That looks just like my signature perfect
dish, spicy meat and seafood fry!

But how did you—?!


Well, I suppose that is not important.
Can I trouble you to share the recipe?"

幸いこの台地には食材は豊富じゃからのう
使った食材の数が多ければ
より多くの体力を回復する料理が作れるのじゃ","You can toss in anything edible.

you use in a dish, the more health it will
replenish when you eat it."

ハーブやスパイスを きかせるのもいい
じゃが…""虫やトカゲといったモノは
食材と一緒に混ぜてはいかんぞ
あまり相性がいいとは言えんからのう…","The idea is to mix heartier ingredients,
like fish and meat, with things like grains
and vegetables.
Spices and herbs help too, naturally.
However... Do not accidentally add in
things like bugs and lizards.
Let's just say...they are not compatible.
In fact, they are quite foul."

それだけじゃないぞ

虫やトカゲを魔物の素材と一緒に煮込むと
思わぬ効果を得られることもある それが薬じゃ","Certain ingredients have special effects,
such as temporarily warming you up or
increasing your stamina.
If you use them when cooking, even a
normal dish will be elevated to one with
a special effect.
Do note that combining bugs or lizards
with monster parts may yield some
unexpected results.
In fact, that's how you make elixirs!"

how to create that dish I wrote about,
my warm doublet is all yours."
32,Cook11,"ケモノ肉が欲しかったら
台地の北側にある精霊の森で狩りをするがいい","If it's raw meat you're after, try hunting

How about you? All done here?"
43,Idou02,"うちに帰るところじゃよ
何も もてなすことはできんが… お主も来るか？","I'm heading home. I can't offer you
much, other than a solid roof and good
company, but you're free to join me."

薪にでもしようかと思うてのう","I thought this tree here might make for
some good firewood."
45,Kikori01,"じゃが…""思った方向に切り倒すのは
なかなか骨が折れる仕事じゃわい
倒したい方向に きちんと体を向けて
腰を入れねばならんからのう","However...getting a tree to fall exactly
where you want it to is quite an art.

The trick is to turn your hips so that they
face where you want the tree to land."
46,Kikori02,"ふう…
だんだん腰が痛うなってきたわ","Phew... Speaking of hips, mine are
starting to ache."
