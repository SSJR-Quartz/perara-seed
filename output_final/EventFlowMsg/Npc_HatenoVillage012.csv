16,talk00,"あぁ旅の人かい？

何も無い村だけど ゆっくりしてけよ","Hey! Traveler, right? I could tell.


Well, there's not a whole lot to see
in this village, but knock yourself out."
17,talk01,"あ…何も無いは言い過ぎたか…

他の町には無い染物屋はあるし","Well... \""Nothing\"" might be going a little
bit overboard...

We do have a dye shop. I don't think 
they have one of those in other towns."
18,talk02,"その青い炎…プルア婆さんのじゃないか？

婆さんの家は こっちじゃない
村の一番東だ","Say, isn't that blue flame... 
Isn't that Grandma Purah's?

Her house isn't near here. It's way on
the eastern edge of the village."
19,talk03,じゃあな,"Well, see ya."
20,talk04,"ラネール山といえば…

ハイラル城のお姫様が禊に使っていたという
「知恵の泉」が山のどこかにあるらしい
お姫様自ら わざわざ出向くほどの泉だ
きっと王家が残したお宝が眠ってるはず！ 
…と俺なんかは思ってしまうわけだ

ただしラネール山は氷に包まれた秘境だ
お宝まで辿り着ける者は少ないだろうな","Yeah, Mount Lanayru's interesting...


The Spring of Wisdom the princess of 
Hyrule used for purification is said to
be somewhere on that mountain.
A special fountain? That the princess
had to endure hardship to visit? I bet 
the royal family left a treasure there!
...Well, at least maybe they could've.
I would've if I was royal.

Anyway, Mount Lanayru is a mysterious
place, and it's engulfed in ice.
If there IS treasure, no one's getting it."
21,talk05,"その青い炎…
研究所の所長さんのじゃないか？
所長さんの家は こっちじゃない
村の一番東だ","That blue flame... It belongs to the 
director at the research center, right?

The research center isn't near here.
It's way on the east side of the village."
22,talk06,北には名峰ラネール山も あるしな,"We also have Mount Lanayru way up to
the north. See it?
"
23,talk07,"ま…時間があるなら
いろいろ見てけばいいよ","Well...if you have some time to kill,
feel free to have a look around up there."
24,talk08,ふぁぁ…あむ…,*yawn* Hm...
25,talk09,ん？,Hm?
26,talk10,やぁ早いね,"Hey, you're out early."
27,talk11,やぁ こんにちは,"Hey, how are you?"
28,talk12,やぁ こんばんは,Good evenin' there.
29,talk13,俺に用か？,You need something?
30,talk14,"ハテノ村から見える名峰といえば
誰に聞いても答えはひとつ…ラネール山だ","Ask anyone what the most famous
mountain visible from Hateno Village is,
and they'll tell you Mount Lanayru."
31,talk15,"ま…そんなこと知って
どうしようって話だけどな","So, yeah... Not sure if any of that
information was actually useful..."
32,talk17,"…ん？旅の人かい？

ようこそ！と言いたいところだが
こんな時間に上がり込むのは いただけないな","Oh, hey! Traveler, right?


Welcome! Or that's what I WOULD say...
This is a pretty abnormal hour for
official welcoming, though."
33,talk18,"ま…今回はいいけどよ
もてなしなんて何もできないぜ？
これといって話題も別にないけど
せっかくだ俺のお気に入りでも教えとくか
ひとつは染め物屋のしゃべり方
もうひとつは ソテツさんのダイエット
あとはそうだな…
北に位置する名峰ラネール山の景観だな
","Well... I guess it's OK this time, but...
I don't really have any welcome gossip...

No real \""talk of the town,\"" per se...
I guess I could give my personal 
highlights?
I guess if I had to name attractions...
I'm partial to the funny-talking guy at the
dye shop or Mr. Seldon's running...
Guess a running man isn't an attraction...
Oh, but we have a view of that famous
mountain to the north, Mount Lanayru."
34,talk19,"知恵の泉ってのはハイラル城の歴代の姫君が
何らかの儀式を執り行う場所だよ
その何らかが何なのかは知らないし
そもそも庶民が近づくような場所じゃないな","The Spring of Wisdom is a place where
the princesses of Hyrule Castle used to
go to do some kind of ceremony. 
No idea exactly what kind of ceremony, 
but anyway, it's not a place where us
ordinary folk go. No princesses here."
35,talk20,"見ての通り畑仕事だよ

自分が食べる分は自分で作る…
それが俺のモットー！
…だが ここで作れないものは アカエゾさんの店
イースト・ウィンドさんで買ってるぜ","I'm the guy that works the field,
obviously. Sometimes, the crops yield
more than I need to feed myself.
When that happens, I harvest all the
produce and send it over to Mr. Pruce's
place, East Wind."
36,talk21,"見ての通り貯水池の確認だぜ

作物が水びたしになる前に
水をせき止めないと いけないからな","You can probably tell, but I'm checking
the reservoir... Irrigation, you know?

If you don't keep an eye on the water
flow, the crops can drown."
37,talk22,"ここで娘の寝顔を見るのが日課でな

おかげで日中が眠いけどな","Sometimes, I can't help but watch my
sweet little daughter sleep at night.
Dreaming her dreams...
Guess you'd have to be a parent to
understand. But lemme tell you, it sure
leaves me sleepy in the morning!"
38,talk23,他に聞きたい事は あるか？,Anything else you want to ask me?
39,talk24,ふぁぁぁ…,Awwwww...
40,talk25,娘の顔見ながら寝よ…,I'll stay up and watch my daughter sleep...
41,talk26,今日は休むとするか…,Guess it's time to knock off for the day...
42,talk27,今日も仕事仕事～♪っと…,♪Another day of work!♪ Yup...
43,talk28,晴れでも雨でも娘のために～♪っとくらぁ,"♪Rain or shine, do that work for my daughter.♪
Guess that's life, and not a bad one."
44,talk29,雨が降ったら貯水池へ～♪ってか,"♪If it rains, I'll go to the reservoir.♪ I guess..."
45,talk30,…おっと独り言聞かれちまった,"...Uh-oh. Someone heard me talking to
myself. Oh, well."
46,talk31,"話なら俺がいつもの場所に着いたら
話してやるぜ","If you want to talk, come find me when
I get settled. Not a good walk-and-talker."
47,talk32,"俺に話しがあるなら
俺が落ち着いてから""話しかけてくれや","If you need to talk to me, just give me
a chance to park myself, OK?
I think better when I'm not moving."
48,talk33,…おっとヘタクソな歌聞かれちまった,"...Oops, someone heard me singing...
badly."
49,talk34,…おっとまた アンタか,"Uh-oh, you again."
