地図を持ってるなら ドクロの形の池を探せ！
そこが まさにアッカレ地方だ！","Hey there, adventurer! You look like you
could use an adventure! If you head
northeast from here, you'll find Akkala.
Do you have Akkala on your map? Look
for a lake in the shape of a skull. If it's
adventure you're after, look no further."

ドクロ池に行く予定はあるか？
もし行ったなら マモノ屋に会うことだ！
…俺は会ったこと ないけどな！","Hey there, adventurer! Were you
considering a trip to Skull Lake?

If you go, promise me you'll check out

俺は南西のリバーサイド馬宿に行く！
南東に進めば カカリコ村にも行ける！
地図を見れば わかるぞ！","Hey there, adventurer! I'm on my way

鉱石は高く売れるって知っているか？
もしも余っているなら どんどん売って
お金に替えた方が有意義かもな！","Hey there, adventurer! You can probably
get a pretty good price for any ore you
sell.
If you've got some spare lying around,
it's probably worth your while to sell
it off and pocket the rupees!"

夜だけ商売するマモノ屋というやつがいて
特別な品が手に入るらしいぞ…","People are trying to rest here, but I've
got stuff to share, so I'd better do it
nice and quiet. You ready, adventurer?
If you find a shop called Fang and Bone,
keep an eye out for the special wares
you can buy only at night..."
22,Rest_01,"とくに何もないよ冒険者さん
しゃべりたくない時だって あるのさ","I got nothing to say, adventurer.
Sometimes, you just don't feel like
talking. Sometimes, you feel like a nap."
23,Rest_02,"冒険者ともなれば
雨の日の崖が滑る事くらいは知ってるよな","Seeing as how you're an adventurer and
all, I bet you're already familiar with the
fact that cliffs are slippery in the rain."

もし アッカレ地方に行くなら
それなりの装備が必要だ！
北に デスマウンテンという山があるから
その麓をめざせばいいぞ！","Hey there, adventurer! A little word of
advice for you...

If you're headed to Akkala, you're gonna
need some basic equipment!

Death Mountain is just to the north of

base first and see about stocking up."

ハイラル城をめざしているのかもしれないが
あそこほど危険な場所を俺は知らない！
命を捨てるくらいの覚悟がないなら
城での宝探しは やめたほうがいいぞ！","Hey there, adventurer! A word of
warning for you...

You might get it into your head to go
check out Hyrule Castle, but I've never
encountered a more dangerous place...

城下町の裏にある入り江から
ハイラル城内に侵入できるという情報がある！
だが あくまでも噂だ！
盗賊を一網打尽にするガセネタかもしれん！","Hey there, adventurer! I've got a little
information to share with you.

I've heard of a secret way into Hyrule

the inlet behind the castle town.
It's just a rumor, mind you. For all I
know, it's a story spread to catch out
thieves trying to break in."

旅先で鉱石を見つけたら採集しておくことだ！
鉱石は高く売れるから
それを元手に旅の装備を整えるといいぞ！","Listen up, adventurer! On your travels,
you may stumble across various kinds
of ore. I recommend you collect it!
Ore will fetch a good price if you sell it,

of the pricier gear you'll find."
