10,talk-Gamyo01,"俺は巨大クジラは世界の砂漠化による
水不足で絶滅したと思ってる！","My theory is that the leviathans of
ancient times went extinct due to a
sudden, cataclysmic drought long ago!"
11,talk-Gamyo04,"くっ… ここで巨大クジラの
議論を続けていても らちが明かねぇな…","Hmph... Debating the cause of extinction
of the leviathans accomplishes nothing
without proof."
12,talk-Gamyo05,"俺はゲルド地方の巨大クジラの骨を
見てみたいんだ！","I must see that leviathan skeleton from
the Gerudo region..."
13,talk-Gamyo07,"絵が ないじゃないか！
持ってきてから言ってくれよ！","Hey, you don't have the picture!
Show it to me once you have it."
14,talk-Gamyo08,"わぉ！３つの巨大クジラの骨の絵を
そろえてくれたんだな！
ありがとうよ！
約束の報酬持っていきな！","Whoa! You got pictures of all three
leviathan skeletons!

よろしく頼むぜ！","I'll give you 300 rupees!
I'm sure you could use it."
17,talk-Gamyo11,"俺は巨大クジラが世界の砂漠化で滅んだ説の
証拠固めを進めるぜ！
後の二人の分も よろしくな！","I'm moving forward with my theory that
the leviathans died out due to global
desertification!
Please help my broth—
Er...my colleagues out too!"
18,talk-Gamyo12,"アンタの絵があれば百人力だぜ！
ありがとうよ！","Your pictures will do wonders for our
research! Thanks again!"
19,talk-Negyui01,"僕は巨大クジラは氷河期の到来により
絶滅したと考えてるんだ…","My theory is that the leviathans of
ancient times went extinct due to an
extended ice age..."
20,talk-Negyui04,"むぅ… ここで巨大クジラの
議論を続けていても らちが明かないね…","Mah... Mere words won't solve the
mystery of leviathan extinction.
We need proof!"
21,talk-Negyui05,"僕はヘブラ地方の巨大クジラの骨を
見てみたいんだけど…","I'd really like to see the leviathan
skeleton in the Hebra region..."
22,talk-Negyui07,"絵を持っていないじゃないか…まぁヘブラ地方の骨は
特に探すのが難しいらしいんだ
何でも閉ざされた洞窟の奥深くに あるとか…
ごめんね""詳しくは知らないんだ","But you're not carrying the picture...Not that I'm surprised—I imagine the
skeleton located in the Hebra Mountains
is incredibly hard to find in all that snow.
Now that I think about it, the only way it
would be preserved in such conditions is
if it were nestled away in a deep cave..."
23,talk-Negyui08,"わぁ！３つの巨大クジラの骨の絵
本当に そろえてくれたんだね！
ありがとう""感謝してもしきれないよ！
これはほんの気持ち""受け取ってね！","WOW! You got pictures of all three

same way!"
25,talk-Negyui10,"そうだよね すぐには見つからないよね…
気長に待ってるから よろしくね","Yeah, you probably wouldn't survive the
journey anyway. But I'll be here if you
change your mind."
26,talk-Negyui11,"君の絵を見ながら氷河期の到来説を
じっくり考えさせてもらうよ！","I'll continue to research my ice-age
extinction hypothesis while analyzing
the picture you provided."
27,talk-Negyui12,"僕は君の絵で巨大クジラが氷河期の到来で
滅んだ説の立証をしてみるよ！
後の二人の分も よろしくね！","Using your picture, I'll be able to prove
my hypothesis that the leviathans died
out due to the onset of an ice age.
My two fellow researchers may need
your help too."
28,talk-Orak00,"私は巨大クジラは火山の大噴火により
絶滅した説を信じている…！","My theory is that the leviathans of
ancient times went extinct due to a
violent volcanic eruption..."
29,talk-Orak02,"うーん… ここで巨大クジラの
議論を続けていても らちが明かないな…","Well... Arguing about the leviathans
means nothing without some manner of
evidence."
30,talk-Orak04,"やぁ君か どうだい？
やっぱり引き受けてくれる気になったのかい？","Hey, stranger. Would you be willing to
do a little job for us? We'll pay you."
31,talk-Orak05,"…おや？ これは失礼
つい夢中になって…
私たちは巨大クジラが なぜ絶滅したのか？
について研究しているのだが…
巨大クジラの骨が眠るという場所が見つからず
ここで空論ばかり交わしているんだ
おおよその場所は検討がついているんだが…北東のオルディン地方""北西のヘブラ地方
南西のゲルド地方 どこも険しい場所ばかりでね","...Oh? Pardon me.
I've gotten ahead of myself.
*ahem*
Why did the leviathans go extinct?
That is the question we scientists are
trying to answer.
However, we haven't yet located any
leviathan remains, so we're stuck with
theories for the time being.
But we do have a general idea of where
such remains might be found...The Eldin Mountains in the northeast,
the Hebra region in the northwest, and
the Gerudo region in the southwest.
The climates of these regions are rather
extreme."
32,talk-Orak06,"君""見たところ なかなか旅慣れているようだし
どうだろう？私達の代わりに…
３つの巨大クジラの骨""一部でも構わないから
詳細な絵を描いてきてもらえないか？
特に欲しいのは頭の部分だから
頭がある程度描かれていれば大丈夫だ
成功した暁には報酬として
300ルピー""出そう！","You've got the look of someone who's
done a fair bit of adventuring.

Would you be willing to find these
leviathan bones and draw a picture
of them?
What I especially want to see is the head
of the animal. If you can get just a bit of
it in the picture, that'd be adequate.
Do this for me, and I'll give you
300 rupees as a reward."
33,talk-Orak07,"そうか仕方ないね…
もし気が変わったら また声をかけてくれ","I see. That's rather unfortunate.
Come back if you change your mind."
34,talk-Orak08,"本当かい？！""助かるよ！ それじゃ
300ルピー""用意して待ってるからね！","Excellent. You are a lifesaver in the most
literal sense. I'll be waiting here with
your 300 rupees!"

見てみたいんだが…","I really need to see the leviathan bones
from the Eldin region."

leviathan skeletons!

My thanks. Here's your reward."

よろしく頼むよ！","Please assist my brothers with their
research goals as well."
38,talk-Orak12,"何だ？""絵なんか持ってないじゃないか！
冗談は よしてくれよ！","Is this funny to you? You think this is a
game?! Don't come back until you have
the picture!"
39,talk-Orak13,"あぁ""焦っても しかたないしな…
待ってるから よろしく頼むよ","Well, I'm not going to beg you...
But, yes! Please do your best."
40,talk-Orak14,"君の絵を基に私は巨大クジラが火山の噴火で
滅んだ説の検証を進めるよ！
他の兄弟たちの分も よろしく頼んだよ！","I intend to prove my theory that the
leviathans died out due to a major
volcanic eruption!
You'll need to help the other two
secure their pictures in order for 
me to disprove their theories."
41,talk-Orak15,"君の絵を見ながら じっくり
自分の説を検証させてもらうよ！","I shall conduct further research on my
hypothesis while making careful study
of your picture!"
