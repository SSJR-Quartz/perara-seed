5,Talk_01,"おはようございまーす！

じゃなくて""サヴォッタ！

いや～ ゲルド語は難しいよね～
頑張って覚えようとはしてるんだけどね～","Good morning!
No, wait—I mean...sav'otta!

Gerudo words... Gotta practice..."
6,Talk_02,"ぷは～っ

これよこれ！

ここのお酒はね
この近くにある氷室の氷を使ってるから
こんな砂漠でも
キンッキンのお酒が飲めるのよね","Ahhhh! This really hits the spot! Nothing
like a cool drink to take some of the
edge off the heat.
All of the drinks here are made using ice
from the nearby icehouse.

That's why we're able to have ice-cold
drinks, even in the middle of the desert!"
7,Talk_03,"やっぱり ここのアクセサリー
キレイだなぁ…
でも素材になる宝石も持ってないし
お値段も お高めだしなぁ…
私には まだ早いかな…","The accessories here sure are pretty...
But I don't have any of the materials to trade, and
buying one outright would be so expensive...
I guess it's just not time for me to own one..."
8,Talk_04,"ヒンヤリダケもいいけど

夜は寒くなるし
ここはやっぱりポカポカダケかな…","Chillshrooms are great, but the nights here are so
cold... Maybe I should get some sunshrooms 
instead..."
9,Talk_05,"サヴァーク！

こんにちはって
サヴァーク だよね？
やっぱりいいよね その服…

涼しげだし私も買おうかな～","Sav'aaq!


I hope that was \""hello\""...


Oh, I really like those clothes. They
look nice and cool in this hot weather.
Maybe I should buy some, too..."
10,Talk_06,"えっと… コンバンハ ってなんだっけ？

あっ！

サヴァサーバ！

酒場にはもう行った？
ゲルドの街に来たからには顔出しとかないとね","Um... What was \""good evening\"" again?
Oh!

Sav'saaba! Have you been to the
canteen yet? Anyone who comes to
Gerudo Town absolutely must go there!"
11,Talk_07,"氷室ってのは地中に穴を掘って作った
氷の保管場所のことだよ
この辺りだとゲルド高地から氷を切り崩して
保管してるみたいよ","The icehouse is an ice depository that
was made by digging a hole in the
ground.
It sounds like they cut ice from the
nearby Gerudo Highlands, take it 
there, and then store it."
12,Talk_08,"大丈夫大丈夫！
あと一杯だけにしとくし～","Oh, I'm fine! I'm only gonna have
one more."
13,Talk_09,"ここの正門でて左の方行ったら
遺跡があるんだけど そこを抜ければ氷室だよ","Go out the main gate and head left.
First you'll see some ruins... Just go
past them and you'll see the icehouse."
14,Talk_10,"えっと～
さよならは…
あっ

サヴォーク！","Oh, darn... What was it...
Good-bye... Good-bye... Sav...

Oh! Sav'orq!"
15,Talk_11,"…美人にしか見えないキノコ

…ちょっと …見えた …かも？","Mushrooms that only beautiful people can see...
I think...maybe I'm starting to see something?"
16,Talk_12,"あ～っ やっぱり その服
ファッションパッションに売ってたやつだよね～
私も買おうかどうか迷ってたんだ～

着心地はど… お？

…って アナタ…
もしかして…
……オトコノコ？","Ah, aren't those the clothes sold at
Fashion Passion? I was thinking about
buying some myself...
How do they feel? Comfy?


Say, are you, uhh... I really don't know
how to say it... Might you be...
A boy?"
17,Talk_13,"やっぱり そうだよね～

すごいじゃん！
よくバレずに ここに来られたね
まぁ… ゲルド族の人達って
あまり細かいこと気にしなさそうだもんね
でも安心して
このことは誰にも言わないから
なんたって今は
同じハイリアのヴァーイだもんね～","You are! I knew it!


It's really impressive—you getting in
here without anyone else noticing!

Don't need to worry. I won't tell a soul.
Just a little secret between us Hylian
vai, right? Hehehe."
18,Talk_14,"せっかくだし
ゲルド語 たくさん覚えて帰りたいよね～","Might as well learn as much of the
Gerudo language as I can while I'm here,
right?"
19,Talk_15,"このお酒ヴァーイミーツヴォーイって言って
このお店の看板商品なんだって～
氷室の氷とのマリアージュも最高だし
何杯でもイケちゃうのよね～","The name of this drink is Noble Pursuit.
It's the signature product of this store.

It really pairs wonderfully with ice from
the icehouse."
20,Talk_16,"ふふ… それにしても
うまく変装したね
話しかけられるたびに
本物の女の子だと思っちゃうもん","Hehe, I have to say... You really make a convincing
girl... I know your secret, and I'm still fooled every
time you walk up!"
21,Talk_17,"あれ…ここってアクセサリー屋さんだよね…？
商品がないみたいだけど まだ開いてないのかな？","Huh? This is an accessory shop, isn't it?
I don't see any accessories on display.
Are they not open yet?"
22,Talk_18,"ここの名物
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイを飲みに来たんだけど
氷が切れてて作れないんだってさ

氷室まで行けば氷はあるみたいだけど
今は人手が足りなくて取りに行けないんだって","I came here to drink the specialty,
Noble Pursuit, but apparently they can't
make it because they're out of ice.
They could get ice from the icehouse,
but that'd leave the canteen unstaffed..."
23,Talk_19,"あーあ誰か
氷室まで行って氷とってきてくれないかなぁ","Ahhh... It'd be nice if someone would
go to the icehouse and get some ice.
I really hope that happens soon..."
24,Talk_20,"大丈夫大丈夫！
これお水だから～","Oh, don't worry!
This is just water, actually..."
