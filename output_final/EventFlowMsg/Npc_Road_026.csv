これから リバーサイド馬宿に向かうところでな
わしは医者なので病人がいないかどうか

医者のわしは いてもたってもいられなくなる
その薬はネルドラのウロコという名前で
聖なる泉の使いと関係があるとかないとか…","As a doctor, I was struck to the core
when I heard there was a medicine
that could cure all kinds of sicknesses.
It's called Naydra's scale, and my
research suggests it's connected to the
attendant to a sacred fountain..."

コッコを驚かせると タマゴを生むらしい
…国家機密じゃなくてコッコ機密だったわい","I once overheard a court secret of the
royal family in the course of doing my
rounds...
If you startle a Cucco, it'll lay an egg!
...Wait, that's not a court secret. It's
a Cuccourt secret."

聖なる泉の言い伝え…
ラネール山 フィローネの森 オルディン火山
それぞれの地方に似たような話があってのう
それぞれの泉で手に入る龍のウロコには
万病を治すという効能があるというんだが…","I may have already told you this, but...
There is a legend about three sacred
springs...
They can be found in Mount Lanayru,
Faron Woods, and the Eldin Mountains.
The stories all say the same thing...
That these springs call to dragon scales.
Although what that means, no one has
yet been able to decipher."

14,MSG_Rane_04,"往診先で聞いた
なんと裸に関する情報だけどね…
ちょっと速く泳げるらしいのう…裸だと","Here's a little something I learned
when I was running around in my

You can swim a little faster...if you're
wearing a little less. "

診療所は持たん主義でのう
湿原の馬宿からリバーサイド馬宿の間を
馬を走らせ往診に回る毎日だ","I'm a doctor, but I prefer not to keep 
my own office. I'd rather make my rounds
and go where I can do the most good.
I spend each and every day running my
poor horse ragged, going between the
Wetland Stable and Riverside Stable."

Listening to the sound of rainfall is a
nice way to calm yourself down."
24,RetMSG_Rane_00,"魔物に襲われかけたりもしたけれど
どうにか湿原の馬宿に辿り着いたわい
病人が いなけりゃ医者も ただの人…
心置きなく休むとしよう","It was rough going, what with all the
monster attacks along the way, but I
made it to Wetland Stable in one piece.
As long as no one needs any medical
attention, I can just relax and be a
normal person. I think I've earned it..."

心置きなく休むとしよう","A doctor with no one to care for is just
a regular person. I think I've earned
a rest..."
26,RetMSG_Rane_01,"万病に効くというネルドラのウロコはご存知か？
ラネール山の知恵の泉にあるらしい
その泉にはネルドラと呼ばれる
龍の姿の精霊がいるという言い伝えもある","I've been researching Naydra's scale,
some sort of miraculous medicine that
works against all kinds of ailments.
From what I've read, it can be found at
the Spring of Wisdom on Mount Lanayru.

The legends also spoke of a spirit there,
a spirit called Naydra that takes the form
of a dragon."

28,RetMSG_Rane_02,"あんたはお若いから やり遂げそうだ…
いやなに ラネール山に登る話だ
万病に効くネルドラのウロコがあるらしいが
あの山の寒さは この歳には厳しすぎるわい","You're young and strong. Maybe you
could take up that challenge. I'm talking
about climbing Mount Lanayru.
Naydra's scale can cure any illness. I
don't know of any doctor alive who
wouldn't thrill at the prospect.
I'd do it myself, but that mountain is far
too cold for these old bones."

ネルドラという名の精霊がいるというぞ
その姿は ドラゴンにそっくりらしいが
どれだけ似ているのか怪しいもんだ","I've never been there myself, but they
say there's a spirit called Naydra at the
Spring of Wisdom.
They say it looks like a dragon, but like
I said, I've never been there myself,
so I wouldn't know."

簡単な薬の作り方くらいは教えてあげられる
要するに虫と魔物の素材を混ぜるだけ
どんな薬ができるか いろいろ試してみるといい","I might not look it, but I'm a plum doctor.
Why, I can even teach you how to make
your own medicine. Nothing fancy, mind.
The basic idea here is to just mix up
insects with monster parts. Experiment
a little, and see what you end up with."
33,RetMSG_Rane_04_1,"虫と魔物の素材を混ぜたら簡単に薬が作れる
どんな薬ができるか いろいろ試してみるといい","Making medicine isn't too hard, once you

whole life, but I just can't cotton to
monsters."
37,SavedLv2_01,"わしなんかのために
若いあんたが怪我したら もったいない…","Well, thank you, but it'd sure be a shame
if someone like you, in the prime of your
life, got hurt helping this old-timer."
38,SavedLv3_00,"あんた怪我はなかったか？
わしは なんとか大丈夫だ…","You aren't hurt, are you? I think I pulled
through all right."
39,SavedLv3_01,"医者のわしが患者になるところだった…
いやいや助けてくれてありがとう！","Imagine the irony—me, a doctor making
my rounds, almost wound up needing
one! Thanks so much for your help."
40,Thanks00,"これは せめてもの礼だ
受け取ってくれ","I don't have much to offer you, but
please, take this as thanks."
