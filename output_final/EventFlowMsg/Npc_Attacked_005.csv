1,"""0000""",知ってる！,I've heard of him.
2,"""0001""",知らない…,Doesn't ring a bell.
3,After00,"異常なほどの興味を魔物に注いで
怪しい研究をしているというマモノ屋キルトン
一体どんなヤツなのか
どうしても会ってみたいのだ","Kilton at Fang and Bone is way more
interested in researching monsters than
any normal person should be.
I'd kind of like to meet him just to see
what kind of weirdo loves monsters
THAT much."
4,After01,"アッカレ地方にあるドクロの形をした池…
その近くに出没するらしい…","The most reliable tip I've heard for
meeting him is to hang around a skull-
shaped lake out near Akkala."
5,After02,"どうやら アッカレ地方だけでなく
世界中で目撃されるようになったらしい…
夜になると どこからともなく出没するそうだ
一体 いつになったら会えるのか…","He's been sighted all over the place now,
not just Akkala. Should I be worried?The creepiest part of the stories is how
he's supposed to pop up out of nowhere
once night falls.
I'm not as sure as I used to be that I
actually want to meet him..."
6,Atacked00,やっつけてやる！,This one's all mine!
7,Atacked01,どうした かかってこい！,What's the matter? Come and get me!
8,Failed00,"くそ… あんなやつに…
私も もっと強くならないと！","Hmph... I would've sworn I could take
that thing. I must be slipping..."
9,Failed01,"いたた…
私としたことが あんなヤツにやられるとは
もっと修行せねば！","Oww... What hurts worst is my pride for
letting them get the drop on me.
Never again!"
10,Guardian00,ガーディアンだ！早く逃げろ！,It's a Guardian! Time to go!
11,Near00,ふう…,Phew...
12,SavedLv1_00,"ちっ…
助太刀されるまでもなかったんだがな
しかし まあ礼は言わせてもらうよ
これを取っておきな","Hmph... I would have been fine on my
own.You probably expect a reward,
huh? Unbelievable. Fine. Here."
13,SavedLv1_01,"ふんっ…余計なことを…
私は これでも剣士なんだぞ
だがまあ助かった
これは礼だ取っておきな","So, what, you saw the sword and shield
and thought, \""She looks like she needs
me to save her\""? Whatever..."
14,SavedLv2_00,"くっ…助けられたようだね

自分でなんとかできたが一応感謝する
さあ これは礼だ…取っておいてくれ","OK, I admit you helped. I didn't need it,
so don't expect any thanks, but you can
have this if you want."
15,SavedLv2_01,"ふぅ…
助けられたな…
ここは素直に礼を言っておくよ
これを取っておいてくれ","Well, you sure made that simpler than it
would've been otherwise. I should do
something to thank you, I suppose."
16,SavedLv3_00,"す… すまない
今の敵は さすがに手ごわかった
おかげで助かったよ
こんなものしかないが取っておいてくれ","Thanks... I might've bitten off more than
I could chew with that one.I don't have much, but take it. It's yours."
17,SavedLv3_01,"なるほど強いんだな…
その風貌を見ればわかる
こんなものしか渡せなくて すまないが
取っておいてくれ","I see you can handle yourself in a fight.
So can I...most of the time. I wish I had more to give you than this,
but times are tough all over, right?"
18,Talk00,"なんだ これ？
って顔をしてるね","So you're probably wondering what that
stuff is."
19,Talk00_1,"マモノエキスを持っているようだが
あんたもマモノ屋キルトンを探しているのか？","I see you've got some monster extract.
Do you know where to find Kilton and his
Fang and Bone, then?"
20,Talk01,"そいつは マモノエキス
マモノ屋キルトンってヤツが作った薬だ 
それを料理に混ぜると ぐっとうまみが増すんだ
間違いなく いい品だから安心しな","It's called monster extract. A guy
named Kilton brews this stuff up at
Fang and Bone.
It's a kind of flavoring that makes any
food taste amazing. I know it's made of
monsters, but it's good stuff."
21,Talk01_01,"なんでも そのキルトンってヤツは…

異常なまでに魔物に興味を持っていて
怪しい研究をしてるらしい
そのマモノエキスの他にも
珍しいものを作っているという噂もある
一体どんなヤツなのか どうしても会いたくて
ほうぼう探しているんだが…
これが なかなか見つからない","There are some weird stories going
around about that Kilton character.
He's obsessed with monsters.
They say he does all kinds of hair-raising
research with them and came up with
a bunch of strange stuff as a result.
I kind of want to meet him at least once
to see if the rumors are true, but he's
a hard guy to track down."
22,Talk02,"あんたも いろいろ旅してるって感じだけど
マモノ屋キルトンって知ってるか？","You seem to get around. You know much
about this Kilton and his Fang and Bone?"
23,Talk03,"知ってるって顔してないよ…
まあいい教えてあげる","Huh! And here I thought he was more
obscure than that. Well, I'll tell you what
little I know. Take this for helping me."
24,Talk04,"そうか…
なら あんたも探すのを手伝ってくれ","Are you interested in finding out more?
I could use some help with the hunt.
Take this, too, for helping me."
25,Talk05,"アッカレ地方のドクロの形をした池…
というところまでは突き止めたんだが
そこが どこにあるのか…","One source I trust says he's most often
found at a skull-shaped lake in Akkala,
but I don't know the place."
26,Talk06,"夜になると世界中いろいろな場所に
どこからともなく出没するそうだ
絶対に見つけて出してやる！","Apparently, he shows up after dark
where you least expect him. It could
be anywhere in the world.
But mark my words...I'll find him
someday!"
27,Talk07,"何っ？！
会ったことがあるだと！
私は そいつをずっと探しているんだ！

異常なまでに魔物に興味を持っていて
怪しい研究をしてるという キルトン
一体どんなヤツなのか どうしても会いたくて
ほうぼう探しているんだが…
これが なかなか見つからない","You've MET him?! Lucky you! I've been
hunting for him forever! Is he as
obsessed with monsters as I've heard?
They say he does all kinds of hair-raising
research with them and came up with
a bunch of strange stuff as a result.
I'd love to meet him at least once to see
if the rumors are true, but he's a hard
guy to track down."
28,Talk08,"また助けてもらうことになるとはね…

おまけに あれからずっと探しているというのに
マモノ屋キルトンは いっこうに見つからない…","I'm so embarrassed you had to rescue
me AGAIN. Ugh. Anyway...

I haven't given up the search for that
Kilton guy and his Fang and Bone, but I
haven't gotten anywhere yet either."
