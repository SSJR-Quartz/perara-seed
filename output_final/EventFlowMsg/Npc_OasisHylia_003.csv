2,"""0001""",さよなら,Good-bye.
3,Near_00,まだかしら…,Is it my turn yet?
4,Talk_00,"アナタも アローマさんの
ウワサを聞いてきたクチ？
彼女のフィンガーテクを受ければ
身も心も生まれ変わるらしいって聞くけど…
こんなに待たされるなんて
ぜんっぜん聞いてないんだけど！
あー イライラするわ…

…で アナタも順番待ち？","Oh, are you here because you heard the
rumors about Romah, too?

I heard that she has a special technique
that will make you feel more relaxed
than you have ever felt in your life.
But nobody said the wait was going
to be this long! I feel like I'll never know
what relaxation is ever again!
Grrrrr, I'm so annoyed...


Well? Are you just gonna stand there, or
are you getting in line?"
5,Talk_01,"……
ウソついてるわね…
アナタ この砂漠の紫外線と乾燥で
お肌 ガサガサじゃない！
アローマさんのエステを受けた後は
身も心も潤うって ウワサなんだから！
…っと あぶないあぶない
怒ると眉間に シワのあとがついちゃうのよね…
まったく…

怒らせんじゃないわよ！","...You're lying...


The desert's dry heat and all the sun
you've gotten has completely dried out
your skin!
Rumors say that part of Romah's special
skills will leave people feeling
moisturized to perfection!
I can't stand when people lie! Grrr...


...Hrmph. OK, I'm fine now.


If I get angry, I'll create wrinkles between
my eyebrows.

Don't make me angry!"
6,Talk_02,"えっ？ なんでなんで？

私なんか ずーっと待ってるのに
ぜんっぜん順番回ってこないんだけど！
…っと あぶないあぶない
怒ると眉間に シワのあとがついちゃうのよね…
…でも確かに
アナタ お肌すっごいツヤツヤね
うん… やっぱり
おとなしく待っとこう","Huh? Wait, did you already...
But why? How?!

I've been here forever—she's not taking
people in the order that they arrived!

Wait! I can't get angry... I won't
get angry...

...
OK, I'm fine now.

You know, your skin looks super shiny,
and you look like you haven't got a
worry in the world...
Yeah, yeah. I should just patiently wait
my turn. It'll be worth it."
7,Talk_03,"ア～ またイライラしちゃった…
またシワになっちゃう…","Argh... I let myself get annoyed again...
I'm gonna get even more wrinkles..."
8,Talk_04,"ほんと… いつまで待てばいいのかしら…

この本何度読み返したことか…
もうほぼ暗記しちゃったわよ
せっかく若返ると思って
エステ受けに来たのに
待ってる間に
シワが深くなった気がするわ…","Seriously...how long am I gonna have
to wait?

I've read this book so many times, I bet I
could recite the dialogue from memory
at this point!
Coming here was going to help me
reclaim my youth, but I feel like I've lost
even more of it while waiting..."
9,Talk_05,"彼女のフィンガーテクを受ければ
身も心も生まれ変わるらしいって聞くけど…
こんなに待たされるなんて
ぜんっぜん聞いてないんだけどね！
あー イライラするわ…

…で アナタはもう受けたの？","I'd heard about her special technique...
One that makes you feel more relaxed
than you've ever felt in your life!
But they didn't mention anything about
this wait!!

So...so mad...


Wait a minute—did you already get to
experience the special technique?"
