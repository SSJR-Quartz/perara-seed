逃げるか隠れるしかない…","I'm not much good in a fight, so if I run
into a monster, my only options are to
run away or to hide."
2,Atacked01,うぅ～魔物がまだいる…,"Sources say there are still monsters
around. These sources are my own
eyes, so they're fairly reliable."
3,Failed00,"魔物と戦えるくらい
強くなりたい…","I've never been strong enough to take on
monsters on my own, but maybe I'll start
training to protect myself."
4,Failed01,ウワサ通り魔物が増えてる…,"Just as the rumors say, the number of
monsters around here is on the rise.
Finally, I was able to verify some info."

教えちゃおう！
ウワサによると魔物を倒すには
遠くから弓矢で頭を狙うと効果的らしいよ
もし知ってたのなら ごめん","Now this is a juicy tidbit of info... What's
that? You wanna know the info too?
Well, OK, but you didn't hear it from me.
I heard that if you're trying to take down
a monster, a head shot with a bow from
a distance is pretty effective.
You already knew that? Well, I never said
it was a little-known rumor, now did I?"
7,MSG_Kyu_00_1,"ウワサによると魔物を倒すには
遠くから弓矢で頭を狙うと効果的らしいよ","You didn't hear it from me, but they say
that one of the best ways to take down a
monster is with a head shot from afar."

光栄です！

では ゴロン族に関するウワサをいくつか…

ゴロン族は硬い鉱石をバリバリ食べるらしい

ゴロン族は溶岩に肩まで浸かって温まるらしい

ゴロン族は ルピーに価値を感じないらしい

あちこち旅してそうなキミには
目新しい情報じゃなかったかな？","If you're only speaking with me because
you wanna stockpile information for
your own personal hoarding...
You're speaking to the right guy, but I'll
deny I ever told you that. Now let me
give you a few juicy tidbits about Gorons.
Those guys eat rock like it's going out of
style. They just gulp 'em down in one
swallow! Craziest thing I've ever seen.
They warm themselves up by taking dips
in bubbling lava. But where do they get
the lava? That's the real mystery.
And most unbelievable of all...
Gorons don't see any value in gems!
I had to fan myself awake at hearing that.
Maybe a well-traveled adventurer such
as yourself knew these things already,
but I guess now you know them twice."
9,MSG_Kyu_01_1,"ゴロン族って硬い鉱石をバリバリ食べて
溶岩に肩まで浸かって温まって…

relax in bubbling lava, and don't see any
value in gems.

that's just plain crazy."
10,MSG_Kyu_02,"ボクには魔物退治なんて無理だけど
魔物については ちょっと詳しくてね
例えばライネルっていう髪をはやした魔物は
すごく凶暴なのに背中に乗れるらしい…とか
リザルフォスの骨を投げると
ブーメランみたいに戻ってくる…とか
まあ自分で試したわけじゃなくて
あくまでも ウワサを聞いただけだけどね","I don't have much of a temperament for
fighting, but I keep my ears open for all
sorts of rumors about monsters.
Not to brag, but I've gotten pretty good
at eavesdropping.

I hear Lynels are very violent, but under
the right circumstances you can mount
them like regular horses.
Disclaimer: attempting to ride a Lynel
is extremely dangerous and is not
advised under any circumstances.
And about those Lizalfos things, if you
throw one of their bones, apparently it'll
come back like a boomerang.
But like I said, I just picked this info up
through some top-notch eavesdropping.
I haven't verified any of it myself."
11,MSG_Kyu_02_1,"ライネルは凶暴なのに背中に乗れるとか

wouldn't recommend trying, pal.

see. I've got rumors for days. 
And they're probably credible."

アイスロッドとかいう武器を振ると消火できる

Hey, buddy. You look like you wanna
know stuff. How about this?
There's this weapon called the ice rod,
ya see? And they say you can use it to
put out fires.
Whaddaya mean that's obvious?!
OK, how about this?

If you take a swing at the boss of the
Gorons, you'll be knocked flat on your
back! Whaddaya mean \""of course\""?!
*harrumph* Well, if you can make friends
with a dog, it'll lead you to treasure!
Was that one obvious?! Huh?!
Anyway, it's not like I've verified any of
these rumors firsthand... I just keep my
ears open, is all."

these things, but...

You can use an ice rod to put out fires,

end with you on the floor.

I got the hottest info around. Rumors,
fresh off the mill!
You didn't hear it from me, but they say
you can float certain ingredients down
rivers and the fish will come right to you.
Try a stamella shroom, and staminoka bass will
come chompin'. And if you float a 
hearty truffle, a hearty bass will show up.
Huh? Why am I whispering some things
and then saying the pertinent information
at a normal speaking volume?
Listen, pal, just pay attention to the
name of the ingredient. That seems to be
an indication of the fish that'll show up."
