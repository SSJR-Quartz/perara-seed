11,Anataha00,"今更 わしのことを知ってどうするつもりじゃ

わしは… もう随分長く ここに独りで
住みついておる変わりもんの じじいじゃよ","Only now you want to know who I am?!
Well...I'm just an old man. One who has
roamed this land for a long, long time."
12,Appear01,いやはや… おどろいたわい,"My, my... It would seem we have
quite the enigma here."
13,Appear02,"大地から次々と
塔が姿を現しおった…
おそらく… このハイラルの大地に眠っていた
力が呼び覚まされたのだ","This tower and others just like it
have erupted across the land,
one after another.
It is almost as though...a long-dormant
power has awoken quite suddenly."
14,Appear03,"して…
塔の上は どうであった？","If you do not mind me asking...
Did anything...odd occur while
you were atop that tower?"
15,Appear04,"ほう…
城の方から声が聞こえたとな","Well now! A voice, you say?"
16,Appear05,"隠さんでもいい

塔の上での一部始終は
わしも こっそりと覗かせてもらったのでな","You need not conceal the truth from me.
Truth be told, I saw the whole thing
unfold from afar."
17,Appear06,"その様子じゃと… お主は城の方から
誰かの声を聞いた… といったところかのう？","Although I could not hear anything, I did
see you react as if you heard something
coming from the direction of the castle..."
18,Appear07,図星のようじゃな,"Hit the nail on the head, did I?"
19,Appear08,お主は その声に心当たりはないのか？,"And did you happen to recognize this
mysterious voice?"
20,Appear09,"…そうか
それは何とも心苦しいのう","I see. Well, that is unfortunate."
21,Appear10,"赤の他人の わしには話したくないか？
まあ それでもいいが…","It seems I have some work to do as far as
earning your trust goes. I suppose that is
understandable."
22,Appear11,"お主も見たであろう
あの城を包み込む禍々しい怨念の塊を…","I assume you caught sight of that
atrocity enshrouding the castle."
23,Appear12,"あれの名は…""厄災ガノン

今から100年前… この地にあった国
ハイラル王国を滅亡させた元凶じゃ
突如として現れた ヤツによって
街は破壊され多くの民たちの命が奪われた
そして今日まで100年もの間…

王国の象徴であったハイラル城に あのような
姿で憑りついたまま… その動きを止めておる","That...is Calamity Ganon.
One hundred years ago, that vile entity 
brought the kingdom of Hyrule to ruin.
It appeared suddenly and destroyed
everything in its path. So many innocent
lives were lost in its wake.
For a century, the very symbol of our
kingdom, Hyrule Castle, has managed
to contain that evil. But just barely.
There it festers, building its strength for
the moment it will unleash its blight upon
the land once again.
It would appear that moment is fast
approaching..."
24,Appear13,"…もしや お主
あの城へ行きたいのか？","I must ask you, courageous one...
Do you intend to make your way to
the castle?"
25,Appear14,そう言うと思っておったぞ,I had a feeling you would say that.
26,Appear15,"…行く気なのじゃな
黙っていても目を見ればわかる","You need not say a word. Your eyes
reveal the determination within."
27,Appear16,"じゃが ここは陸の孤島…
この絶壁の台地から出ることは不可能じゃ","Here, on this isolated plateau, we are
surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs,
with no way down."
28,Appear17,"もし飛び降りようものなら…
地面に叩きつけられ ひとたまりもないじゃろう","If you were to try to jump off, well...
no death could be more certain.
Or more foolish."
29,Appear18,"まあ わしのように
パラセールを持っていれば話は別じゃがな","Of course, if you had a paraglider
like mine, that would be quite
another story."
30,Appear19,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
いいじゃろう
じゃが… タダというわけにはいかん","Oho! Certainly! Why not? But there is no
such thing as a free item in this world,
you know."
31,Appear20,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
さっき わしが降りてきたときに使った道具じゃ
お主に くれてやってもいいが…
タダというわけにはいかん","Oho! Piqued your interest, have I?
Yes, I didn't come soaring down here
on my own feathery wings, you know!
Worry not—I will happily agree to give
you my paraglider. But not for nothing."
32,Appear21,"そうじゃな…

では あるところに眠る お宝と交換
というのはどうじゃ？","Let's see now...


How about I trade it for a bit of treasure
that slumbers nearby?"
33,Appear22,わしに ついてまいれ,Come. Let me show you something.
34,ClearTerrorEnemy,むう…,Hmm...
35,GoodBye00,"パラセールが欲しいのじゃろう？
お宝楽しみにしておるぞ","Treasure for the paraglider.
A fair exchange, I believe."
36,GoodBye01,楽しみにしておるぞ,"I am looking forward to your
successful return."
37,NakedPlayer,裸とな…,Aren't you...a bit chilly?
38,Near00,ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ,Oho ho!
39,Talk00,"焦るでない…
もう少しばかり先じゃ ついてまいれ",Don't be hasty now. Just follow me.
40,Talk01,"今 わしの見ている先に
怪しげに光る祠のようなものが見えるな？","Do you see that structure there?
The one shining with a strange light?"
41,Talk02,"あれは塔が地面からせり出したのと同時に
あのように光り始めたのじゃ","It began glowing at the exact moment
those towers rose up from the ground."
42,Talk03,"ああいう場所には
たいがい お宝が眠っておるものよ","I would think such a place might house
some sort of treasure, wouldn't you?"
43,Talk04,"わしの見ている先にある光る祠から
お宝を取ってくるのじゃ","I want you to go there and fetch me
any treasure you find inside."
44,Talk05,"わしの見ている先にある光る祠から
お宝を取ってくるのじゃ","I want you to go to that shrine there and
fetch me any treasure you find inside."
45,Talk06,さあ早う光る祠から お宝を取ってこい,"Go on! Fetch me any treasure you find
inside that shrine."
46,TerrorArrow,何をする！,What is this?!
47,TerrorBomb,何じゃ？,What is it?!
48,TerrorEnemy,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
49,TerrorExplosion,ぬわーっ！,Huh?!
50,TerrorFire,あちゃっ,Toasty...
51,TerrorImpulse,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
52,TerrorInsect,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
53,TerrorSword,やめんか！,Easy there!
