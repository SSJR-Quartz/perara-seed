22,talk12,"強い弓を使って一発で仕留めるのが
コツといえるかもな
あとはそう…シカに気づかれにくいように
近づくことも大事だぞ","A trick? Well, I guess it helps to have
a strong bow to take 'em down with
one shot.
And of course, you want to get close
enough to the deer to line up your shot
without them noticing you."
23,talk13,"よっし！ありがとう！

お願いってのは他でもない
奥のエキスパの森でシカを狩ってほしいんだ
そこの野生のシカが増え過ぎちゃって
森を荒らされて困ってるんだよ
だから なるべく多くのシカを速やかに…
そう…1分以内に狩ってほしいんだ","Woo-hoo! I had a lucky feeling you were
the answer to my prayers!So what I need is for you to hunt some
deer out in Retsam Forest.They're overpopulated these days, and
it's destroying the forest.That's why I was hoping you could hunt
all the deer you can...in one minute."
24,talk14,シカ狩りを手伝ってくれるのかい？,Will you hunt some deer for me?
25,talk15,"ありがとう！
すぐに行ってくれるかい？",Thank you! Can...can you go right away?
26,talk16,"なんだか腕が立ちそうなボーイだな
ひとつ頼まれてくれないか？","You look handy with a bow. Mind helping
a poor farmer out?"
27,talk17,"そっか…
気が変わったら また頼むよ","Oh. Well, shucks. Let me know if you
ever change your mind."
28,talk18,"じゃシカ狩りのほう始めてもらおうかな
1分経ったら呼ぶからね","About that deer hunting... No time like
the present, right? Go get started, and
I'll call you once your minute is up, OK?"
29,talk19,どうだ？できそうかい？,So? You think you can do it?
30,talk22,時間だ！戻ってくれ！,"That's time! Come back, wanderer!"
31,talk23,"あれ？！
一匹も狩れてないじゃないか？
すまんがこれでは お駄賃はなしかな","Huh? You didn't even get ONE? Sorry,
but no results, no reward."
32,talk24,"とはいえ あの森のシカ…
また増えると困るし…
というわけで もう一度 お願いできないかな？","The thing with these deer, though...
We really have to get their numbers
under control.Hey, wanderer, can I ask you to
go again?"
33,talk25,"狩れたのは""匹か…
ありがとう","You got  deer...
Thanks for doing your part!"
34,talk26,"全部で匹とは
ボーイ…なかなかやるじゃないか","You got  deer!
You're downright vicious with that bow,
wanderer!"
35,talk27,"匹も狩れたのか！

やってくれるボーイだとは思ったけど
正直ここまでとは！","You got  deer?!
I knew you were a go-getter, but this is
more than I ever dreamed of!"
36,talk28,"匹も狩ったんだね！

キミ すごいよ！
ここいらで最高の シカ狩りボーイだよ！","You got  deer?!Easy there, wanderer. I didn't think I'd
be saying this, but there's such a thing
as being TOO good a hunter."
37,talk29,ホイお駄賃だ…,Here's a reward for you...
38,talk30,お駄賃奮発しとくからな！,I won't skimp on it this time!
