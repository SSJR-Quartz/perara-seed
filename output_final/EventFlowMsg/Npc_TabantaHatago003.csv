WHAM and mows down all kinds of
monsters like KAPOW would be amazing!
I mean, even the name—the sword
that seals the darkness—is just the
coolest thing ever!"
8,talk_0003,"退魔の剣だよ！
ハイラルのどこかにあるっていう伝説の！
その剣 ひと振りすれば…
切先から聖なる光があふれだし…
どんな魔物も なぎはらい
平穏をもたらすという…ハァ… ロマンだ！","I'm talking about the sword that seals
the darkness, of course! Legend has it
that it's hidden somewhere in Hyrule!
A single swing shoots out sacred light
beams...mows down wicked monsters...
and restores peace and stuff...
Ahhhh, it's every dreamer's dearest
dream come true, I tell ya!"

beat the stuffing out of every single
monster on the Hebra Mountains!"

12,talk_0052,"えっ？ それが退魔の剣だって？ふんふん…ハァ～…
なるほどなるほど…
想像してたより ずいぶんと細身の剣なんだな伝説の剣っていうくらいだから もっとゴツくて
俺の背丈くらいあるかと思っていたぜ
いやぁいいものを見せてもらったよ！
一生の思い出になりそうだ","HUH?! That's the sword that seals 
the darkness? I can't believe it!

Deep breaths... Deeeeep breaths...
OK. I see, I see... Hmmm...

Honestly, it's a tad slimmer than
I imagined.

Since it's the legendary sword,
I thought it would be as big as me!
With, like...jewels everywhere.
Wow, it's still amazing, though. I can feel
the power. Hey, thanks for showing that
to me! I'll never forget this day!"
13,talk_0053,生きてるうちに実物を見てみたいぜ…,I'd love to see it one day...

選ばれし勇者の剣…もしや君が…
辛いことも多いと思うが くじけるなよ！","If the legends are true, the sword that
seals the darkness is the blade of the
chosen hero... Are YOU that hero?!
If so, you'll likely face many hardships
in your life...but never give up!
Promise me that."
15,talk_0100,"ヘブラ山脈を散策するなら
外の鍋で寒さをしのげる料理を作るといいぞ
何の対策もなしに雪山へ行くのは
冒険者として失格だ！","If you plan to roam the Hebra Mountains,
you should make some food to help you
withstand the extreme cold.
Feel free to use my cooking pot outside.
Going to a snowy mountain unprepared
is unacceptable for a true adventurer!"
