7,Book00,"リーバルの日記""を読みますか？","Read The Diary of Revali,
the Rito Legend?"
8,Book01,"今日行われた弓術大会で また優勝した
村では僕の連勝記録の話で持ち切りだ
ぶっちぎりの成績と新記録の樹立
リト族の誇りとも讃えられ悪い気はしない
族長から優勝の褒美を聞かれたので
弓の訓練場が欲しいと言っておいた
今の僕には上下の落差を訓練できる場所が
必要だ… あの技を完成させるためにも","I won another archery competition today.
As one would expect, the village can't
stop talking about my winning streak.
In short order, I've managed to break
all of the previous records and set an
insurmountably high bar.
Everywhere I go I receive praise and
affirmations that I am the pride of
the Rito. I...could get used to this.
The elder asked me what I would like as
a prize for my achievements. I told him
I wish for an archery training ground.
If I am to keep this up, I need somewhere
to train at varying elevations. I'm hoping
to master a new move I've dreamed up..."
9,Book02,"今日も一日弓の鍛錬に励んだ
急降下からの上昇に まだキレが足りない
明日も訓練場に行こう…
あそこで もっと上手く強くなるんだ
訓練場には僕に憧れてる子供達も来たいと
言ってるそうだ…皆の修行場にしてもいいかな
明日は気になってる事を試してみよう
あそこの上昇気流… あれを自在に作れたら…","I keep pushing my archery skills to the
limit. My dive is ideal, but the ensuing
ascent is not as smooth as I wish it was.
I must return to the Flight Range again
tomorrow. There, I will become stronger.
Better. I won't rest until I succeed.
The Rito children look up to me.
I hear they wish to start training
at the Flight Range too.
Perhaps it's not a bad idea to allow
everyone to use my training space.
These are dangerous times, after all.
Tomorrow I will try a new strategy I've
been devising to control the updraft.
I refuse to believe it's impossible."
10,Book03,"どうもキナ臭い噂話ばかり耳に入ってくる…
厄災ガノンとやらが復活するとかしないとか
何年か前 メドーって遺物が掘り起こされて
噂になったけど あれはガノンと戦うモノらしい
ハイラル王国は あれの繰り手を捜してるという
…けど誰にでも扱えるってモノじゃないそうだ
神獣を操るには強力な聖なる力が必要だという
…操れれば そいつは強い力の持ち主ってわけだ
やってやるのも悪くない…神獣を操って
厄災を倒せば この力を世界に示す事が出来る","There is a persistent rumor in town
that Calamity Ganon's resurrection is
imminent. It can't be true... Right?
A few years ago, scientists dug up an
ancient mechanical beast called Medoh.
It was supposedly used to fight Ganon.
Hyrule's royal family is in search of
someone to pilot the beast. They say to
do so requires something beyond skill.
They say one's soul must contain an
incredible sacred power for a Divine
Beast to recognize them as master.
They should have just asked for me
by name.

To control the Divine Beast and defeat
the Calamity...would finally allow me to
prove myself to the world."
11,Book04,"ハイラルの姫が神獣に乗ってくれと頼んできた
けど詳しく話を聴いてみれば実にふざけた話だ
神獣は援護の為に使うもので厄災と戦う主役は
ハイリア人の何とかという騎士らしい
馬鹿馬鹿しい どうして そいつを支える
脇役を やらなきゃいけないんだ？
即座に断ってやろうと思った時
ハイラルの姫が こんな事を言った
「この大地に棲む生きとし生ける者全てを
厄災の魔の手から護らなければなりません…」
こんな恥ずかしい事を言える奴を僕は初めて
見た… けど姫の顔は真剣そのものだった
…ハイリア人ってのは自分の事しか考えないと
思ってたけど あんなのもいるんだな
姫に免じ返事は保留にしてやる事にした","Hyrule's princess stopped dawdling and
asked me to pilot the Divine Beast.
I asked what our plan is.
I wish I hadn't. It is completely absurd.


The Divine Beasts are little more than
backup for some Hylian knight who has
the honor of fighting Calamity Ganon.
ME! A sidekick! I thought of declining,
but then she looked me dead in the eye
and held my gaze as she said...
\""We must protect the precious life of
this land from the Calamity's grasp at
all costs. Hyrule needs you, Revali.\""
It was so corny, I almost died.
But I won't soon forget the look in her
eyes. She meant it with all of her heart.
I thought Hylians only thought of
themselves, but I suppose there's
an exception to every rule.
I'm going to accept, of course.
But out of self-respect, I'm going
to let her sweat it out a bit longer."
12,Book05,"明日 ハイラルの姫が返事を訊きにやって来る…
この話受けるつもりだ
あと一歩で あの技を完成させられる
皆が あれを目の当たりにすれば…
誰だって厄災と戦うべきは何とかという名の
騎士じゃなく このリーバルだと思い直す筈だ
ハイラルの王や姫… それにその騎士自身が
僕に ひれ伏してお願いする姿が目に浮かぶな
「リトの戦士リーバル様 どうか神獣の繰り手も
厄災ガノンの討伐も お頼み致します」って","Hyrule's princess is coming by to ask
for my answer tomorrow. She will surely
be overcome with joy when I accept.
And her timing is exceptional. I am close.
So close to mastering my new move and
showing everyone what I'm capable of.
When they see it, they'll know without
doubt it should be ME fighting Ganon
instead of that pathetic knight.
I can see it now. The king and princess...
AND the knight...all on their knees,
begging me to defeat Ganon for them.
They'll say, \""Please, Master Revali!
Please use your otherworldly skills
and intellect to defeat Calamity Ganon!\""
I look forward to that day."
13,Book06,"ハイラル城で叙任式に参加し英傑なんて
たいそうな称号をもらった
名前や恰好で強くなれるなら苦労はないが
まあ この青のスカーフは ちょっと気に入った
あの無口でイケ好かない騎士は今日もずっと
無表情だった… あいつは何を考えているのやら
確かに あいつの腕が立つのは見ればわかる
子供の頃大人の騎士に全勝って話も本当だろう
でも僕には敵わない…
あの動きに ついてこれる奴なんていない
ああ そうだ… あの技に名前を付けなくちゃな
何が良いかな… リーバル…タイフーン？","I journeyed to Hyrule Castle for an
inauguration ceremony. I now bear
the grand title of \""Champion.\""
Meaningless pomp, if you ask me. If true
strength relied only on title and uniform,
everyone would be a Champion.
I do like the blue scarf, though...


That annoyingly silent knight was as
emotionless as usual. I can never tell
what's on his mind. Likely nothing at all.
Somehow I can't help but believe the
stories about him beating adult knights
in swordplay when he was only a child.
Still, he doesn't stand a chance against
me. There is no one alive who can
keep up with my aerial combat.
That reminds me. It's about time I came
up with a fitting name for that new move
I created.
What kind of name would be worthy?
Revali's...something. Tornado?
Whirlwind? Masterpiece? Hmm."
14,Book07,"今日 あの騎士が
村に公用で訪れた姫についてやってきた
姫と族長が話してる間声をかけたが
あいつは相変わらずで面白くもなんともない
完成したばかりの大技 リーバルタイフーン改め
リーバルの猛りを披露してやったが反応は無し
こっちも まだまだ成功率の低いなか無理して
みせてやったのに…
もしかして こいつは何も分かってないのか？
そう思って挑発してみたけど やっぱり反応無し
張り合いが無さ過ぎて馬鹿馬鹿しくなって
メドーに引き揚げてきた…何なんだ あいつは","The princess came to the village on
official business, along with her shadow,
that insufferable knight.
I tried to talk to him while the princess
met with the elder, but he was his usual
quiet self. Why do people like him so?
I also gave him the privilege of seeing
me perform Revali's Gale. Nothing.
No reaction at all to my impressive feat.
I showed it to him even knowing there
was a chance of failure, since it's still
so new. He must truly be slow-witted.
I tried to provoke him into facing me,
but to no avail. It's like talking to
a stone.
Our interactions were a waste of time,
so I flew off to find solace with Medoh.

What's wrong with that guy?"
15,Book08,"明日 ハイラルの姫をラネールに送っていくって
連絡を ダルケルから受けた
朝早くに麓まで見送って日の暮れに
山から戻って来る姫と あいつを出迎えるという
どうしてそんな面倒に付き合わなきゃいけない？
そう思ったが ふとあの姫の顔が浮かんできた
神獣に乗って欲しいと頼みに来た時 あの姫は
使命を果たせない焦りで必死だったんだろうな
才能の無い人間の苦悩なんて正直分からないが
あの姫の努力してる姿は… まあ嫌いじゃない
そうだな…見送りは流石に行かないが
夕方ひとっ飛びして出迎えだけはしてやるか
…もしかしたら封印の力って奴に
目覚めてるかもしれないしな","Daruk informed me that we have been
asked to escort the princess to Lanayru.

We're to see the princess off at dawn at
the mountain's base and meet her there
when she returns at sunset.
Must I participate in this nonsense?
Though...I still remember that look
on the princess's face.
When she asked me to pilot the Divine
Beast, she was not only determined...
she seemed desperate.
She's aware she can't fulfill her
sacred duties, and anyone can
see how it weighs on her.
It's difficult for me to comprehend
the troubles of the talentless, but...
I'm trying.
It's not that I dislike the princess.
She tries her hardest. It's simply
not good enough.
No, I don't think I can spare the time to
send her off in the morning, but perhaps
I will fly over to greet her at sunset.
Perhaps that alleged \""sealing power\""
will show her some mercy and finally
awaken this time."
