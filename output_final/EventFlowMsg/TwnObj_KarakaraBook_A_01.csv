ミツバおススメ度 ★★★★★","This is Traysi! I have a taste for
the rumors of worlds long gone and
worlds yet to come!
Everyone gossiping in the present
world? Here's my favorite bit of the
latest news...
The Secret of the Royal Family
of Hyrule

I heard a rumor that there's something to
be found inside Hyrule Castle...

And that something is a secret room of
Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, the last
king of Hyrule!
There's also supposedly a laboratory that
belonged to his daughter, Princess
Zelda. A double discovery!
I bet there are all kinds of amazing
royal-family secrets hidden in those
rooms just waiting to be revealed!
\""Secrets of the Royal Family Uncovered!\""
That headline alone would keep food on
the table for months!
But there's no way I'm going anywhere
near a place as dangerous as Hyrule
Castle. No way!
Don't let that scare you, though...
Traysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★"
