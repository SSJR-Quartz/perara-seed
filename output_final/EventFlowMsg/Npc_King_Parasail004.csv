11,Appear01,"どうやら克服の証を手に入れたようじゃな…
まずは よくやったと誉めてやろう","It seems you managed to get your hands
on a Spirit Orb. Well done!"
12,Appear02,千里眼 …というやつじゃ,"Clairvoyance! Oho, or perhaps just
something similar."
13,Appear03,"歳を取ると目の前の物は見え難くなるが
逆に隠された物が見通せるようになるのじゃ","As one gets older, it can become more
difficult to see what is right before
one's own eyes...
However, that which was once hidden
from view can often be crystal clear."
14,Appear04,"誰にでも身につくもの ではないがのう
ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ","But perhaps that is not true for
everyone! Oho ho!"
15,Appear05,"待て待て まずは と言ったろう…
気が早いヤツじゃ","I encourage you to slow down for
a moment, my courageous friend."
16,Appear06,"しかし塔の出現といい この祠といい
全ては お主の腰のそれ…","The appearance of those towers and
the awakening of this shrine..."
17,Appear07,シーカーストーンとやらに縁があるようじゃな,"It is all connected to that Sheikah Slate
you carry on your hip there."
18,Appear08,"シーカーストーンと聞いて
わしも思い出したのじゃが…","It has been quite some time since I have
seen that Sheikah Slate..."
19,Appear09,人の話を聞けい！,I have yet to finish speaking!
20,Appear10,"その昔 この地にはシーカー族という
高度な文明を持った民がおってな…
その叡智の力によって この地を幾度となく
脅かした厄災を払ったそうじゃ","Long ago, a highly advanced tribe known
as the Sheikah inhabited these lands.

The great power of their wisdom saved
this kingdom time and time again."
21,Appear11,"彼の文明は遥か昔に絶えた… と聞いていたが
まさか こんな祠に隠されておったとはな…","But their ancient technology disappeared
long ago... Or so it is said.

It is interesting, however, to think...
how something like that survived all
this time, hidden away in a shrine."
22,Appear12,"よいか
こうした祠は この地に いくつも存在する","These shrines are tucked away in
numerous places all across this land."
23,Appear13,"この台地にも あと3つほどあったはずじゃ

その全ての祠で克服の証を手に入れたとき
お主にパラセールを渡してやろう","On this plateau alone, I believe there are
still three more.

Bring me the treasure from each of
those shrines...and I will give you
my paraglider."
24,Appear14,"うむ…少し気が変わってのう
だが お主であれば そう大したことでもあるまい","Oh? Well, I suppose I changed my mind.
I'm sure that won't be a problem for a
young go-getter like you!"
25,Appear15,"わしは お宝とは言ったが 1つとは言っておらん
お主であれば 1つも4つも そう変わるまいて","I said \""treasure,\"" but I never said there
would only be one treasure.

Whether it's one treasure or four,
what's the difference for a young
go-getter like yourself?"
26,Appear16,"その代り祠探しのコツを教えてやろう

祠に限らず ものを探すには
高いところから見回す のが一番じゃ
そうじゃのう…","Since I'm feeling generous, I will also
teach you a trick for finding shrines.

It's always best to survey the area by
looking around from a high point.
Let's see here..."
27,Appear17,もう一度 さっきの塔に登ってみたらどうじゃ？,"How about you make your way to the top
of that tower again?"
28,Appear18,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ

慌てるでない
もうひとつ いいことを教えてやろう","Oho ho!


I am afraid not. But do not worry!
I have another little trick to share
with you for your effort."
29,Appear19,"慌てるでない
もうひとつ いいことを教えてやろう","I admire your eagerness! But allow me to
teach you something else before you go."
30,Appear20,シーカーストーンのマップを見るがいい,"Take a look at the map on your
Sheikah Slate."
31,Appear21,"お主が出てきた この祠
そして塔にも青い印がついておるじゃろう？","See those blue icons? You should
recognize the cave where you woke,
the shrine you came from, and the tower."
32,Appear22,"シーカーストーンの力を使えば
その場所にワープできる… と聞いたことがある","You can travel instantly to any of those
places with the Sheikah Slate."
33,Appear23,"と言うても昔の話じゃ…
嘘か真かは わからんがな","Or so I heard quite some time ago...
I do not know if it actually works
as such."
34,ClearTerrorEnemy,むう…,Hmm...
35,ClearTerrorGuardian,危なかったのう…,That was close...
36,GoodBye00,早う行け,Go on. Time is of the essence!
37,GoodBye01,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
パラセールが欲しかったら がんばることじゃ","Oho ho! If you still wish to acquire the
paraglider, you must put in the effort.
I will not simply give it away, you see."
38,Kotsu00,"ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ
年寄りは何でも知っておるものじゃ
ほれ さっそく試してみんか？","Oho ho! When you have been around
as long as I have, you pick up a thing
or two. Go on, why not try it out?"
39,Kotsu01,"シーカーストーンのマップを開いて
青い印のついた塔を選ぶのじゃ
さすれば瞬時に そこまで移動できるそうな…
試してみるといいじゃろう","Open the map on your Sheikah Slate,
and select the blue tower icon.

You'll be able to travel there instantly
that way."
40,NakedPlayer,裸とな…,Aren't you...a bit chilly?
41,Near00,ふぉっ ふぉっ ふぉっ,Oho ho!
42,Talk00,"塔の上まで ワープしてみることじゃ
そこから眺めれば祠などすぐに見つかるぞ","Try traveling to the top of the tower.
From there, you should be able to scout
the location of another shrine."
43,Talk01,ほれ残りの祠を探すため塔に登るのじゃ,"Go on! Get to the top of that tower,
and find those remaining shrines!"
44,TerrorArrow,何をする！,What is this?!
45,TerrorBomb,何じゃ？,What is it?!
46,TerrorEnemy,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
47,TerrorExplosion,ぬわーっ！,Huh?!
48,TerrorFire,あちゃっ,Toasty...
49,TerrorGuardian,ガーディアンじゃっ！,A Guardian!
50,TerrorImpulse,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
51,TerrorInsect,ひぃーっ！,Whoa!
52,TerrorSword,やめんか！,Easy there!
