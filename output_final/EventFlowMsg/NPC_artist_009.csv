これが大妖精の泉…？
美しいといえば美しいが…
もっとこう…神秘的で奥ゆかしい感じかと…","...


This...is the Great Fairy Fountain?


It's certainly beautiful, but...I thought
it would be more...sacred and elegant."
10,Talk01,"大妖精の泉も良かったが
この村の建造物も なかなか味わい深いな…","The Great Fairy Fountain was lovely,
but this village's architecture is
quite elegant as well."
11,Talk03,"うむ この門と雪山の写った絵だな……

この村からずっと東に行くと大きな雪山がある
ラネール山という山だ
そのラネール山のふもとにある
ネルドーラ雪原の西に その門があったはずだぞ","Hmm. A gate and a snowy mountain...


Ah! There's a big snowy mountain east of
this village. It's called Mount Lanayru.

I think there was a gate at
the bottom of Mount Lanayru,
west of Naydra Snowfield."
12,Talk04,"おお キミか！""良いところに！
聞いてくれ！
あの後大妖精の泉の事を
自分なりに調べてみたんだが
やっと怪しい場所を見つけたんだ！

でも…
なかなか泉に たどり着けなくてね…
絵でもいいんだ…
どうしても見てみたいんだが…","Oh, it's you! Great timing! I have some
news. I did more research regarding the
Great Fairy Fountain...and I have a lead!
However...although I know of the spot
where it's likely located, it's really hard
to get there. I'm not sure I can do it...
*SIGH* Even if it's just a picture,
I'm dying to see it..."
13,Talk05,"はるか昔ラネール山の山頂は
竜の棲む聖域と言われていたらしい
伝説での話だとは思うが…… もし本当に
いるのなら ぜひ描いてみたいものだ","A long time ago, Mount Lanayru's peak
was said to be a sacred place where
dragons lived.
I think that's just a legend...but wow,
if it's true, I would love to capture that
in a piece of art!"
14,Talk06,"ふむ門を見つけたようだな
顔を見れば わかるよ","So you found the gate? Heh, I can tell
just from the look on your face."
15,Talk07,"昔は この門を行きかう人もいたのだろうな……
栄枯盛衰とは よく言ったものだ","There must have been a time when lots
of people used that gate... The world
sure is fickle, isn't it?"
16,Talk08,"ん？ キミは……？
失礼だが キミも旅をしているのかね？
私は絵が趣味でね
美しい風景を求めて旅をしているんだ
ここだけの話なんだが…

この村の近くに それはそれは美しい
大妖精の泉というのがあるらしいんだ…
その泉は美しいだけでなく
不思議な力を与えてくれるという…
粘って調査した結果
怪しい場所は見つけたんだが…
なかなか泉にたどり着けなくてね…

絶景に出会えた時の感動…
キミも旅人なら わかるだろう？","Hm? Are you... Sorry to bother you,
but are you a fellow traveler?

As for me, I just looove art. In fact,
I'm traveling the world in search of
beautiful landscapes.
Just between you and me...


I hear there's a Great Fairy Fountain
somewhere near this village. I hear
it's breathtakingly beautiful.
Aesthetics aside, they also say the place
can bestow people with some kind of
mysterious power...
I've been researching it for ages,
and I finally have a lead. There's a
place that is beyond suspicious...
The problem is, I can't seem to find
the fountain there.

*sigh* Nothing beats the thrill of tracking
down a perfect view. As a fellow traveler,
you understand the sentiment, right?"
17,Talk10,"この村を離れて もう何年もたつからね
調査も大変だったんだよ
しかも キミも気づいてると思うけど
この村の人は みんな同じ装束だろ？
間違って同じ人に
何度も聞いちゃったりしてね…
もともと変わり者と言われてたのに
今じゃ さらに不審者扱いだよ…
でも絶景を見れるなら不審者になるぐらい
私は全然平気だけどね","It's been years since I've visited this
village, so it was hard to dig up info.

As you've probably noticed, the people
here all wear the same attire.

I made the mistake of asking the same
person the same thing multiple times.
Oops.
I was already a stranger to the village,
but now I'm a suspicious roamer to them.

But if it helps me track down a beautiful
landscape, I don't care what people
think of me!"
18,Talk11,"つ… つかれた…
坂道は年寄にはこたえるな…
私は これ以上は無理そうだ…

この祠の裏に大妖精の泉があると
言われているんだが いつもここで息切れだ…
はぁ…""私はちょっと休ませてもらうよ

もし見つけたら
絵を忘れないでくれよ","So...tired... Hills aren't easy for
old fogies like me. Sorry, but I
don't think I can go on... *pant*
The Great Fairy Fountain should be...
along the path that leads past
the shrine. *pant*
That's what I've been told, anyway.
Yeesh, I'm completely out of breath!
That always happens right about here.
*pant* I think I'd better rest for a bit.
You go on ahead.

And hey, if you find it...don't forget to
get a picture!"
19,Talk13,"おお！ やはりか青年よ！
同じ絶景マニアの ニオイがすると思ったよ！
大妖精の泉の場所は
まだハッキリとは わからないんだが
一か所怪しい場所はあるんだ…

これから またそこに行こうと思ってるんだが
興味あるなら キミも一緒にくるかい？","Oh! I knew it! I just KNEW there
was someone like me nearby who
appreciates true beauty.
Sadly, I can't pin down the exact location
of the Great Fairy Fountain.

I haven't put it all together yet,
but there's a suspicious place
I have my eye on...
In fact, I was about to head there now.
Would you like to come along?"
20,Talk14,"おお！若者らしい良い返事だな！
では ついてきたまえ！","Great answer! Just what I expected from
a fellow beauty connoisseur like you.
All right then. Follow me!"
21,Talk15,"ん？
なんだ キミも大妖精の泉に興味があったのか！
ハッハッハ絶景好きに悪い奴はいない！
ヨシ！""私がそこに案内しようじゃないか","Oh? You're interested in the
Great Fairy Fountain too?

Ha! Well! Anyone who loves beautiful
scenery as much as I do is a friend.
OK, that settles it. I'll guide you there!"
22,Talk16,"大妖精の泉は美しいだけでなく
不思議な力を与えてくれるという…
絶対 アソコが怪しいと思うんだが…
なぜ見つからないんだ…","The Great Fairy Fountain isn't just lovely,
they say it can bestow some kind of
mysterious power on people.
I'm pretty sure that one suspicious spot
is where it's hidden... But then why can't
I find it?"
23,Talk17,"おっ ヤル気十分だな！
キミがそんなに絶景好きだとは思わなかったよ！
じゃあ行こうか！","Wow, you sure are high-spirited!
I didn't know you loved beautiful
landscapes quite so much.
Well, shall we?"
24,Talk18,"大妖精の泉…
絶対…見つけ… るぞ…","Great Fairy Fountain...
I will...find you..."
25,Talk19,"高台の奥にある アソコの辺りが
怪しいんだけどな… なぜ見つからないんだ…","The area beyond that elevated bit of land
is suspicious...but why can't I find the
Great Fairy Fountain?!"
26,Talk20,"絶景を見たい気持ちは
誰にも負けないつもりなんだが…
体がついていかないんだ…
こうしてる今も膝が笑ってるよ…","My desire to view beautiful landscapes
is stronger than anyone else's.
Ever, I'm pretty sure.
But my body just can't handle the
groundwork... Even now, my knees
are trembling."
27,Talk21,"ん？ キミは…？
失礼だが キミも旅をしているのかね？
私は絵が趣味でね
美しい風景を求めて旅をしているんだ
実は この村の近くに それはそれは美しい
大妖精の泉というのがあるらしくてね
