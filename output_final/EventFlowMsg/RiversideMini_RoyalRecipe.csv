6,Talk00,"おや お客さん一人旅ですかな？
ぜひ この美しい川沿いの宿でご休憩ください","Ah, a customer. Are you traveling alone?
This inn gets full marks for beauty, so I
highly recommend taking a rest here."
7,Talk01,"おや？ こんな雨の中一人旅ですかな？
ぜひ この美しい川沿いの宿でご休憩ください","Traveling alone—and in the rain no less?
This inn is a thing of beauty, rain or
shine, so it's a fine place to take a break."
8,Talk02,"この川も美しいですが ここから北東に進むと 
とても美しい湿地帯千の中州があります
私 美しいものに目がないのですよ
この麗しい体を見てもお分かりでしょう……？","The river here makes for some lovely
scenery, and if you head northeast from
here, you'll find the Millennio Sandbar.
The scenery there is every bit as lovely
as the scenery here!

I'm something of a connoisseur of
beauty, you see—I simply cannot
resist a beautiful sight!
I try to exude this in all things, not least
of all my own beautiful appearance."
9,Talk03,"ところで お客さん…
なかなか美しい目をしていますね","Speaking of, has anyone ever told you...
You have the most beautiful features!"
10,Talk04,"よろしければ私の思い出話
お聞きになりませんか？","Ahh, I do have many fond memories of
this beautiful land... If you have the
time, would you indulge me?"
11,Talk_Challenge00,"このハイラル平原を北に行くと
禍々しい雰囲気のお城が見えてきます
今では魔物の巣窟と成り果てていますが
かつては とても美しかったのでしょう
そこでは私の祖先…祖父の祖父が
宮廷料理人として働いていたそうなのです
王家の方々はどのような
料理を召し上がっていたのだろうか…
私は幼い頃から美しい料理を妄想しながら
様々な料理を食べました
極上ケモノステーキ海の幸カレー
キノコリゾット たまごプリン
ふふっ
この麗しい体はそのおかげかもしれませんね
今では馬宿で働きながら立ち寄った旅人と
美しい料理の話をするのが楽しみなのです
…さて
話が長くなってしまいました
旅の方 あなたの美しい目を見込んで
お願いがあります
もしハイラル城に足を踏み入れることがあれば
どこかに料理レシピの文献が残っていないか
調べてきていただけないでしょうか？
ぜひ王家の料理を食してみたいのです","If you head north through Hyrule Field,
you'll see the castle surrounded by that
foul aura.
It has long been a den of monsters, but
in its glory days it was surely a thing of
wondrous beauty.
It was in that very castle in those very
days that my ancestor... Hmm, my
grandfather's grandfather, I believe...
Anyway, he worked as the castle's
appointed chef! I couldn't believe
it myself!
Oh, how I wonder what sorts of cuisine 
members of the royal court enjoyed in
those good ol' days...
As a child, I would often suffer meager
meals, all while dreaming of the beautiful
dishes that might have graced my plate.
Oh, if only things had been different!
Gourmet spiced meat, seafood curry,
mushroom risotto, egg pudding...
Oh, my, I think I'm salivating. And it's my
pursuit of those childhood dreams that
explains the fabulous body you see here!
These days, I enjoy my time working at
these stables, sharing my tales of beauty
with any traveler willing to listen.
But I still wonder what could have been.
Anyway, excuse me... I seem to have
caught myself prattling on.
But looking upon your perfectly
symmetrical face and discussing meals of
beauty has rekindled my desire.
If you should happen to set foot inside
Hyrule Castle, could you find it in you to
keep an eye out for a cookbook?
There must be one lying around
somewhere in there! I'm simply dying to
finally sample the food of the royal court."
12,Talk_Challenge01,"ハイラル王家の料理…
今でも作れるのなら食してみたいものです","A cuisine lovely enough to be favored by
the Hyrulean royal family... If the recipe
still exists, I'd love to try it!"
13,Talk_Challenge02,"えっ？！
ハイラル王家の料理レシピを発見したのですか？","You what?! You really discovered a royal
cookbook?"
14,Talk_Challenge03,"ぜひ作っていただいて
私に味見させていただけませんか？","Could I bother you further to prepare the
dish for me? I must sample it!"
15,Talk_Challenge04,"ぜひ作っていただいて
私に味見させていただけませんか？","Could I bother you further to prepare the
dish for me? I must sample it!"
16,Talk_Challenge05,そんな… ひどい…,"To taunt me with such a delectable and
beautiful aroma yet not share...
So cruel..."
17,Talk_Challenge06,"これがハイラルの姫が食したと言われる
フルーツケーキ…","This... This is the fruitcake said to be
eaten by the princess of Hyrule..."
18,Talk_Challenge07,"もぐ もぐ もぐ…
……ごくんっ","*crunch* *munch...munch*
*gulp*"
19,Talk_Challenge08,"ふあぁぁ…
……これは…
草原を馬で駆け抜けるような爽やかな香り…
いや そんな単純な味じゃない
途中でガーディアンに見つかったような
ピリッとした緊張も感じられる…","Simply...delicious... How could I possibly
describe this experience?

A refreshing aroma reminiscent of
galloping across these majestic planes
on horseback...
No, that undersells the dish's complexity.


It fills me with that heart-thumping
intensity that seizes your very soul
when you're spotted by a Guardian!"
20,Talk_Challenge09,"なんと美味なる料理！
こんな料理があったとは！
いやぁ素晴らしい料理をいただきました
これは心ばかりのお礼です","A truly elegant dish! I never thought I
would taste something quite so thrilling.

I really must thank you for giving me
such a beautiful meal! Here, take this.
For your trouble."
21,Talk_Challenge10,"これがハイラルの大臣が食したと言われる
マモノケーキ…","This monster cake is said to have been a
favorite of the minister of Hyrule."
22,Talk_Challenge11,"ふおぉぉ…
……これは…
チュチュをかじったようなドロドロした食感…
いや そんな単純な味じゃない
ヒノックスにガツンと殴られたような
脳天を刺激する旨味が感じられる…","It tastes...beautiful...
How can I put it into words?

It's like biting into a Chuchu...


No, no, that would be disgusting and
dangerous. It stimulates the brain, much
like being pummeled by a Hinox!"
23,Talk_No,"そうですか…
またいつでも お声掛けください","Oh, I see...
Very well. I'll be here if you change
your mind."
24,Talk_Yes,"聞いていただけますか！
ありがとうございます
それでは……","Oh, you would?
Even more beautiful on the inside!
Now, let's see..."
25,Talk_near00,お腹すいた…,I could go for a bite...
26,Talk_near01,宮廷料理…じゅるり…,"Mm, royal cuisine..."
