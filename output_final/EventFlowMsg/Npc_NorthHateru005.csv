13,talk001,"なんだァ…男かよ！

この馬宿に居ると男にしか会わねェな…","Really?! Another guy?!


The only people I can meet here at this
stable are men..."
14,talk002,"おっ…？！
久々のベッピン……ん？
なんだァ…男かよ…

そんな服着て…ゲルド族はだませても
ハイリア人は騙せないぜ…
しっかし…
この馬宿に居ても男にしか会わねェな…","Oh! Hey, girl...
It's been a while since I've seen a
vision as fine as you around he—
Wait a sec...
You're a guy, aren't you?

Look, pal. Those clothes might fool
someone from Gerudo, but they're not
fooling this Hylian.
*sigh*
I should have known I wouldn't meet any
women at this crummy stable."
15,talk005,"ん？おめェさんか…
なんだァ？","Hm?! Oh, it's just you... You want
something? Or are you just here to
disappoint me again?"
16,talk010,"男ばっかりの むさ苦しい馬宿だぜ…

つい最近も ゾーラ族が来たと思ったら
プリンスだとか言って…男だったぜ…
俺の癒しは サトリちゃんだけだァ…","It's a filthy stable filled with nothing but
unwashed men...

And even when we were finally visited by
a Zora...turns out he was some
manly prince guy who's a dude.
Satty's the only reason I'm sticking
around this dump."
17,talk020,"ここから東を見てみろよ
妙な雲で おおわれてやがるだろ？
雨とか ほんと気分が悪ぃや…
サトリちゃんに癒してもらわねェと…","Take a look to the east.
It's always covered in clouds, right?

Rain and stuff really sours my mood.
Good thing Satty's here to cheer me up."
18,talk030,"謝ってもらいたいわけじゃねェよ…

最近 この馬宿に立ち寄るのが
おめェさんとかゾーラ族のプリンスとか…
男ばっかだったからよォ…","I don't want to hear it.


The only visitors we get at this stable
these days are guys like you and the
Zora prince.
Men. Men everywhere..."
19,talk040,"知らねェのか？
魚みたいな ツルっとした奴らだよ
ここから東…ゾーラ川の上流にある
ゾーラの里に住んでるんだ
腕の立ちそうなハイリア人だから
里へ来てほしいと言われたんだが…
サトリちゃんを危険な目にあわせたくねェから
断っちまったんだ…","You don't know who the Zora are?
They're, like, slippery fish people.

They live east of here...up Zora River in
a place called Zora's Domain.

They wanted me to stop by their domain
because they need a Hylian for
something...
But I don't want to abandon Satty or put
him in danger, so I'm in a bit of a tight
spot..."
20,talk050,あァ…またな,Yeah... See ya.
21,talk060,"サトリちゃんはなァ…俺の命の恩人なんだよ…
…長くなるが聞くかい？","Satty? Well...I owe him my life.
It's a pretty long story—are you sure you
want to hear it?"
22,talk061,"じゃあ話すぜ…

ある時にだけ動物が現れるっていう
奇妙な山の事は知ってるかい？
俺は その噂を聞きつけて…
一儲けしてやろうと行ったのさ…
狩りつくして肉なんかを売り飛ばそうってな…","All right. Here goes...


Have you heard that rumor about the
strange mountain on which a bunch of
animals appear at a certain time?
Well, when I heard that, I went there
to do some hunting.

I thought it sounded like a good
opportunity to turn a profit, selling
the meat and whatnot..."
23,talk062,"山に行った俺は動物が現れるのを
じっと待ってたんだ…
そこに きったねぇ子犬がいたんだ…
親とはぐれたのか人に捨てられたのか…
エサをねだってきやがったから…
干し肉を分けてな…","So I go to the mountain and wait
for the animals to show up.

When suddenly this dirty little pup
appears out of nowhere!

I figure he's been separated from his
parents or abandoned by his last owner.

He starts begging for food, so I give him
some jerky, and he runs off over a hill..."
24,talk063,"ある日 つい夜中にうとうとしちまって…
気づいたら目の前に でけェ光るヤツが…
完全に油断してた俺は
弓を引くのも忘れて…見入っちまった
ヤツは…俺を踏みつぶそうと迫ってきた

そこに エサをやった子犬が割り込んできたのよ
何十倍もあるヤツに向かって吠えて…
俺のことを…守るためによォ…
震えながら……","Later on, I doze off for a little while, and
when I come to, there's a big glowing
beast standing right in front of me!
It caught me completely off guard.
I couldn't even draw my bow!
I just stared at it.
And then the beast runs at me like it
wants to trample me!

Suddenly the pup I gave food to jumps
in between us! He starts barking at the
beast, who was ten times his size!
All to...protect me...
Even though he was trembling with fear..."
25,talk064,"そしたらヤツが少し怯んだのさ…

俺はそのスキに子犬をひっつかんで
転がるように山を下りてきたってワケさ…
…

…ま それだけっちゃ それだけの話なんだがな

で その奇妙な山ってのが
中央ハイラルの西にあるサトリ山…
その時に会った子犬が
今のサトリちゃんさァ
あんた…勇気があるなら
行ってヤツに会ってみなよ…","Then the beast recoiled a bit...


So I took that chance to snatch up the
pup and flee down the mountain,
tripping and falling all the way...
...


And that's my story.


The strange mountain is called
Satori Mountain. It's west of
Central Hyrule.
I brought Satty back here, and we've
been best buds ever since.

If you're feeling brave, you should go
find that glowing beast on the mountain
and give it a stern talking to."
26,talk065,"なんだよ…またサトリちゃんと俺の
感動秘話を聞きたいのかい…？","You wanna hear the touching story about
how Satty and I became best friends
again?"
27,talk070,そうかい…またな,Oh... Bye.
28,talk100,さて…今日は何が起きるかなァ…,I wonder what'll happen today...
29,talk101,雨だなァ…,"Ugh... Where's the sun?
And the girls?"
30,talk110,腹が減ったなァ…,I'm so hungry right now...
31,talk120,"ヤツが…… ヤツが…来る……
逃げろ… サトリちゃん……","The beast... It's...back...
Run, Satty. Save yourself..."
