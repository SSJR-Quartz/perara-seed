mountains?"
13,talk01,"寒いとこに行くなら
ウチで服を揃えて行きなよ","If you plan to go someplace cold, you
should consider buying some of our
warm clothes."
14,talk02,"例えば北の雪山やここより高いところは
素人さんだと凍死しちまうくらい寒くてな
が ウチの服を揃えれば
素人さんでも その寒さに耐えられるってわけよ
ささ とりあえず
一度中に入って自慢の商品を見てみてよ！","Go up into the Hebra Mountains or
anywhere higher than here, and even
experienced climbers freeze to death!
But bundle up with some of our warm
clothes, and even an amateur can make
it to the summit!
So come on! Check out our wares!"
15,talk03,まいど！ それじゃ中で選んでくれ,"Great! Come in and shop your little
heart out!"

to see you up at this hour."
20,talk08,"ここは防具屋紅孔雀だぜ

まぁ中に入って見てくれよ
俺達 リト族の羽毛を編み込んだ商品の数々！
…おーっと！ ちなみに俺みたいな
オッサンの羽毛は編み込んでないぜ？
編み込んでるのは季節の変わり目に抜け落ちる
柔らかくて暖かい赤ん坊の羽毛さ
だから そんじょそこらの服とはワケが違う
全部揃えれば どんな寒い所でもヘッチャラさ！","Welcome to Brazen Beak, 
armor shop extraordinaire.

There is no need to be shy, sport!
We have incredible gear made from the
very pride of the Rito—our plumage!
But it isn't as if I just tore out some of
my feathers and glued them on a shirt.

No, we weave together only the softest,
thickest baby feathers that are naturally
molted with the changing of the seasons.
You will not find clothes of this quality
anywhere else! With my clothing, you'll
stay comfy in the coldest of weather!"
21,talk11,雨ン中 ご苦労さん！,Thanks for coming in this rain!
22,talk14,"……あ！ もしかして
テバと一緒に行った人かい！","...Oh! Could you be the one
who aided Teba?"
23,talk15,"俺が言うのもなんだけど その節はありがとな！

あのバケモン…""正直気味悪くてさ…

それはそうと ニーチャンは
まだ旅続けるんだろ？","Hey, I just want to say thanks for doing
that.

The nerve of that beast...
It really ruffles my feathers.

Anyway, I imagine you will be off on
another adventure soon, huh?"
24,talk16,"ニーチャン！ ウチの商品買い揃えてくれたの？
だとしたら ありがとよ！
それ全部着てりゃ
雪山だろうが上空だろうが ヘッチャラだぜ！","Hey, sport! So you got the whole set
at our shop?

Thanks for shopping with us. That outfit
will serve you well when climbing snowy
mountains and flying way up high!"
25,talk17,"ニーチャン… そんな格好でよく平気だねぇ
ウチで服""買って行きなよ…","Heya, sport... You must be miserable
wearing just that around here.
Why not buy some armor at my shop?"
26,talk18,"ふぅ…しかし

あんなバケモンに居座られちゃ
観光客も減るし商売上がったりだぜ
こんな時ゃ休憩するに限るってもんよ","Hmph... Well if you ask me...


That beast looming over our village is
going to scare away potential customers.

I guess that means now is a good time
to take a break."
27,talk19,"空はあんなだけど
ぶつくさ言ってても しゃあねぇや
難しい事は族長に任せて
俺は自分の仕事をするだけだぜ","The world's falling apart, but there's no
use in me complaining about it.

I have a job to do. The village elder can
worry about all of the doom-and-gloom
mumbo jumbo."
28,talk20,"やぁ まいど！
…じゃ なくって こんにちは
今まさに空のバケモンの話をしてたとこよ","Howdy!
...I mean, hey. We were just talking about
that beast in the sky."
29,talk21,"あのバケモン""実は昔村の英傑リーバル様が
アレに乗って村を守ってくれてた ってよォ
つまり あの空のバケモンは
もともと あっしらの味方だった ってェ話","So that beast was actually something the
old village Champion, Revali, rode to
protect us back in the day.
In other words, that beast in the sky
used to be an ally of ours. Can you
believe it?"
30,talk22,"おいおい それ
今俺が話そうと思ってたのによ！",Hey! I was just about to tell him that!
31,talk23,"なんでィ！
おめぇだって族長の請け売りじゃねぇか！","Whatever! You're just copying what
the elder said anyway!"
32,talk24,ん？ まだ何か用かい？,Hm? You need something else? 
33,talk25,…じゃなくてまたな！,I mean...see you next time!
34,talk26,"俺は実際に見た事は無いんだがよ…

リーバル様ってのは 100年前の大厄災に
立ち向かったうちの一人だぜ
俺もそうだったけどよ
リトの男なら ガキの頃必ず
「将来はリーバル様のような立派な戦士になれ」
って親に言われて育つもんだぜ","Not that I was there to see it, but...


Revali was one of the warriors who
died in battle 100 years ago during the 
Great Calamity.
All Rito males are urged from birth to
become honorable warriors just like
Revali.
No pressure, right? I mean, he was
basically the greatest warrior to ever live."
35,talk27,"射る矢細を穿ち
天翔ける事疾風の如し ってェ…
そう伝えられる リーバル様なんだがよォ

大厄災で どうなったかは
ハイリア人のアンタなら お察しでさァ？","\""All his arrows found their mark;
he flew like the wind itself...\""
That is what they say about Revali.
Though as a Hylian, I'm sure you know
all about the events of the Great
Calamity."
