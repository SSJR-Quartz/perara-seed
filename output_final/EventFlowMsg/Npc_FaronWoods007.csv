the fire, if you'd like. 

I'm a traveling merchant. Name's Giro. 
Nice to meet ya!

Crazy times we live in, eh? I go into the
forest all on my own to get my wares...

But there are far safer ways to get 'em.
Such as buyin' from travelers like you!

So... Do ya happen to have anything rare
you'd be interested in sellin'?"
