7,talk00,"ねえ シーバ…

そこに立ってるお兄ちゃん
馬に興味があるのかな？","Hey, Shibo... You think this nosy guy right here
is interested in horses?"
8,talk05,"そうだね ダート…

馬に乗りたくてしかたないって目をしてるよね","Looks like it to me, Darton... Judging from his eyes,
he's just itching to get into the saddle."
9,talk06,"野生のお馬さんは臆病だから
人間に気付くと すぐに逃げちゃうんだ！
後ろから そぉ～っと近づいて
近くまで行ったら…
ひょいって飛び乗るんだよ！","Wild horses get scared easily, and if they
notice people near them, they'll take off.

Just sneak up on 'em from behind real
slow. When you get good and close...

grab 'em and jump on quick!"
10,talk07,"ブチがあるお馬さんはブチ種っていって
おとなしくて人になつきやすいんだ
逆に黒や白とか一色のお馬は単色種っていって
気性が荒くて手なずけにくいんだよ","Horses with spots on them are even-
tempered and easy to train.

On the other hand, horses that are all
one color, like straight black or white,
are a bit more wild and harder to train."
11,talk08,"野生だから なついてない間は
変な方向にいったり時には暴れたりするんだ
そんなときは なだめてあげるといいんだって","They're really wild, so they'll run in
different directions and buck here and
there because they aren't trained yet.
When that happens, you've gotta soothe
them!"
12,talk09,お兄ちゃん わかった？,"Hey, mister! Ya get all that?"
13,talk10,"父ちゃんにいっぱい教えてもらったんだ！
お馬さんの事なら任せてよ！","Dad taught us a lot.
Just leave the horsin' around to us!"
14,talk11,"もう馬が気になりすぎて
馬以外のことは どうでもよくなりかけてる目だよね","You're right. He's got eyes that just say, like...
\""Nothing in this world matters to me
except horses.\"""
15,talk12,"馬をヒヒーンと乗りこなすための
ヒヒーントがいっぱい！
…あ今のはぼくじゃなくて
父ちゃんが考えたダジャレだからね！","Do you want to hear some tips to help
you master your horse? Yay or neigh?

I didn't think of that joke, by the way. That's one
of my dad's jokes!"
16,talk13,…ってことは？,That means...
17,talk14,…ってことは？,THAT MEANS...
18,talk15,ぼくらの出番ってこと！,"That means we've got ourselves
a customer!"
19,talk16,"ヒヒーン！
ようこそ双子馬宿へ！
正確には…
ようこそ双子馬宿の馬小屋前へ！","Howdy, mister man! Welcome to
Dueling Peaks Stables!

Or...welcome to the front of
Dueling Peaks Stables, I guess."
20,talk17,"目を見ればわかるんだ！

お兄ちゃん
馬のことで頭がいっぱいだよね？","You really can tell just by looking into
his eyes!

Bro, his head is just filled with horse
stuff, right?"
21,talk18,"そう！目を見ればわかるんだ！

お兄ちゃんの今の頭の中って
馬馬馬馬飯馬馬…だよね？","That's right! Just look at his eyes!
Right now in his head, it's all horses,
horses, horses, food, and horses...right?"
22,talk19,"だったら ぼくらがお役に立てるよ！
馬のことならぼくらに聞いて！","In that case, you should feel free to ask
us anything at all about horses!"
23,talk20,"しゃがんでそぉ～っと近づけば…

気づかれにくいんだ！","If you crouch and sneak up quietly...


they won't notice you!"
24,talk21,"でも単色種って スタミナが多くて
走るのも速いんでしょ？","But a one-color horse has more
stamina and runs faster, right?"
25,talk22,"最初は大変だって父ちゃん言ってたけど
単色種は慣れるとすごく重宝するんだって","Dad said they're hard to handle at first,
but if you spend a lot of time with a
one-color horse, you'll be best buds!"
26,talk23,"父ちゃんは初心者なら
まずはブチ種にしとけって言ってたけど 
オレは大きくなったらまず単色種に乗るんだ！","Dad also said that beginners should start
with spotted horses... When I grow up,
I'll ride a one-color horse, though!"
27,talk24,"でも やみくもに なだめても
ダメって父ちゃん言ってたよ","But dad also said that just constantly
soothing them won't do at all."
28,talk25,"ちゃんと いう事を聞いたときに
なだめてあげるんだよ
お馬さんに乗る時とか…降りる前とか…
「ありがとう」の代わりにするんだよ！","The trick is to soothe them when they do
what you want them to do.

It's like saying \""thanks\"" to them for a job
well done!"
29,talk26,"じゃあね バイバイ！
またね ヒヒーン！","See ya! Bye-bye!
Take care, now!"
30,talk27,あっ双子じゃないお兄ちゃんだよ シーバ！,"Look, Shibo, it's the twinless dude!"
31,talk28,あっ双子じゃないお兄ちゃんだね！ ダート！,"Look, Darton, it's the—
Oh, you already said that."
32,talk29,"父ちゃんにいっぱい教えてもらったんだ！
お馬さんの事ならオレ達に任せてよ！","Dad taught us a lot! If you wanna know
about horses, just ask us!"
33,talk30,ねむくなっちゃった…,So sleepy...
34,talk31,"ブチ種さんが1匹…
ブチ種さんが2匹…","One spotted horse...
Two spotted horses..."
35,talk33,"今日はダートより早く
お馬さんの所に行くんだ！","Today I'm gonna beat Darton
to the place where the horses are!"
36,talk34,"父ちゃんはお馬さんのチャンピオンの
次のチャンピオンなんだ！","My dad was the second-best horse
guy, you know!"
37,talk35,やった！今日はダートより早く着いたぞ！,All right! I got here before Darton!
38,talk36,すごいだろー！,"Pretty impressive, right!"
