7,Diary_00,"ローム・ボスフォレームス・ハイラルの手記を
読みますか？","The Writings of
Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule"
8,Diary_01,"今日明けの刻娘が産まれた
王家の習わしに従い ゼルダと名付ける
極度の筆不精である儂だが これを機に
備忘録代わりとして手記を認めようと思う","Today, as the sun rose and a new day
was born, my daughter, too, joined this
sweet world.
In keeping with the traditions of
the royal family, I have decided
to name her...Zelda.
I am not a man accustomed to frivolous
musings, but now seems as good a time
as any to begin my royal memorandum."
9,Diary_02,"各地から遺物出土の報告が相次ぐ
占い師の予言は真実を言い当てていた様だ
厄災ガノンは言い伝えや寓話の中だけではなく
このハイラルに存在していたのだ
全ての遺物を検分しなければならないが巨大な
神獣だけでも4体… かなり時間を要するだろう
ゼルダに遺物の話をしてやると瞳を輝かせて
聞き入っていた…あれには学者の気質がある様だ","Reports keep arriving regarding the
excavation of relics. The fortune teller's
predictions seem to be coming true.
Calamity Ganon was not a figure of fable,
or even of legend. He actually existed in
our great land of Hyrule.
We must investigate all the relics, learn
as much as we can. But understanding
the Divine Beasts alone will take time...
Zelda's eyes lit up like a wildfire when
I told her about the relics... I must admit,
she has a knack for research."
10,Diary_03,"王妃が急逝した
突然の事で実感が沸かない
ゼルダは国葬の間も儂と二人だけの時も
毅然として涙を見せる事は無かった
王家の姫として気丈に振る舞うべしと
繰り返し言い聞かせ育てたからであろうか
6歳にして立派な品行であった…これからは
あれの母に代わって儂が娘を育てていかねば","My queen has left this world. Her death
was so sudden and unexpected, I awaken
most nights unsure if she is really gone.
Zelda never cried, never faltered. Not
even during the royal funeral or later
when she and I were alone with our grief.
I must assume her strength is a result of
us repeatedly informing her of her duty
to be a valiant and steady princess.
For a child of merely six years of age,
her conduct was truly that of a born
leader. Her strength gives me hope.
From now on, I must raise her all alone...
Now, only I remain to prepare her for her
difficult future as princess of Hyrule."
11,Diary_04,"泉より戻ったゼルダの報告を受ける
聖なる封印の力は未だ兆候すら見えぬ様だ
あれの母が亡くなってから 1年と3ヶ月
まだ精神的に立ち直れていないのかもしれない
厄災ガノン復活の予言が無ければ焦らずとも…
と思うが今の状況では悠長に構えていられない
ゼルダには酷だが泉での修行を増やす様に
命令する必要がある","Zelda finally reported back after her visit
to the fountain. It seems her sacred
sealing power has still yet to awaken.
It has been a year and three months
since her mother passed. Perhaps she is
held back by heartache too deep to heal.
If the Ganon prophecy wasn't looming
over our heads, I would tell her to take
her time... To wait until she is ready.
But our situation is dire and leaves no
room for weakness—even on behalf of
my beloved daughter.
My heart breaks for Zelda, but I must act
as a king, not a father. I must order her
to train relentlessly at the fountain."
12,Diary_05,"またゼルダが遺物調査に向かったとの報告を受け
本人を呼び出し問い但した
修行の休み日を使っての調査だと
言い訳を述べるが それを一喝する
学者の真似事に感けているから力が得られぬのだ
と もう何度目かも判らぬ説教を繰り返した","I was told Zelda went off to research
ancient technology, so I had no
choice but to confront her about it.
She claims she was simply using her day
off from training to indulge in a bit of
research, but still I scolded her.
She won't get it through her head...
Forcing me to tell her the same thing
I have been repeating ad nauseam.
The reason her sacred powers still won't
awaken is because she's spending all her
efforts playing at being a scholar!"
13,Diary_06,"本音を言えば あれの気持ちが分からぬでもない
師となる母に何一つ教わらぬまま先立たれたのだ
書物も存在せぬ修行を独学で闇雲に繰り返し
既に10年の時だけが無駄に流れた
王宮の一部の者達に陰口を叩かれ
唯一の血縁である儂にも叱責を受ける
好きな遺物研究に逃げるのも無理からぬ事だと
思うが王家の者として責務は果たさねばならぬ","In truth, I understand Zelda's feelings.
Painfully so. She lost her mother, her
teacher, before she could learn from her.
Ten pointless years of self-training,
without so much as a book or note
to help her find her way...
Those in the castle talk behind her back.
And I, her only family, scold her for
her shortcomings.
No wonder she wishes to hide away in
her beloved relic research. I'd love
nothing more than to console her...
But I must stay strong. She MUST
fulfill her duty, just as we all must.
Even if she comes to despise me."
14,Diary_07,"今朝 ゼルダが知恵の泉に向かったとの報告を
受けた
あれにとって最後の賭けにも等しい修行だろう
ラネールで駄目ならば もう他に場所は無い
…もしも力が発現せず戻って来た時には…
叱責するのではなく あれと話し合ってみよう
儂が10年間ゼルダに課した修行…封印の力を
目覚めさせる方は それ以外に有るのやもしれぬ
あれの好きな遺物や歴史の研究を進めさせれば
そこで手掛かりが見つかる可能性も有ろう
とにかく今は父として娘が
この城に戻って来るのを待とうと思う","I have been told my Zelda went to the
Spring of Wisdom...

This will likely be her last chance.
If she is unable to awaken her power
at Lanayru, all hope is truly lost.
If she comes back without success,
then I shall speak kindly with her.
Scolding is pointless now.
I forced 10 years of training on her...
and after all that, it seems her power
will stubbornly awaken some other way.
Perhaps I should encourage her to keep
researching her beloved relics. They may
just lead her to answers I can't provide.
For now, I sit anxiously, more a father
than a king in this moment. I sit and
await my daughter's return."
