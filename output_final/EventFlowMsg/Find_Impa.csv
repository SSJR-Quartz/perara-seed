Please hurry inside."

雨の日はご注意ください","Metallic objects attract lightning.
Please be careful on rainy days."
8,Talk09,"我々シーカー族は
英知の民として知られていました
その技術は 1万年前に起った厄災の際
ガノンを封じる要となり
一時は神の力とさえ言われ称えられましたが
次第にそれは国にとって脅威とされ
シーカー族は疎まれる存在となり
国を去らざるを得なくなりました…
その時に我らのように
技術を捨て普通に生活する者もいれば
王国に恨みを持ち
ガノンに忠誠を誓う者もあらわれました
それがイーガ団と呼ばれる者達なのです

奴らの使命はガノンに仇なす者を排除すること…
貴方様も どうかお気を付けください","We of the Sheikah tribe have long been
heralded as a people of great wisdom.

Our technology became the key to
sealing Ganon away during the Great
Calamity, some ten thousand years ago.
At one point, our technology was praised
as the power of the gods...but eventually
the people turned on it. Turned on us.
Our creations came to be viewed as a
threat to the kingdom. The Sheikah
became outcasts, forced into exile.
Some, like us, chose to cast off our
technological advances and strove
to live normal lives.
Others fostered a hatred toward the
kingdom that shunned them. These sad
souls swore their allegiance to Ganon.
They now call themselves the Yiga Clan.


Their sole mission is to eliminate all who
stand against Ganon. Please, dear hero...
be careful out there."
9,Talk10,失礼いたしました,Please forgive us for behaving so rudely.
10,Talk11,なに奴！ ここはインパ様のお屋敷,"You there! Who are you?! How dare you
trespass upon Lady Impa's abode!"
11,Talk12,"知らなかったこととはいえ
大変失礼いたしました…
最近イーガ団が不審な動きをしておりまして…
いやはや面目ございません","Though it was simple ignorance, I must
apologize again for my actions.

Lately the Yiga Clan has been stirring up
trouble. We are all on high alert. Still...
That is no excuse for my behavior."
12,Talk13,"知らなかったこととはいえ
大変失礼いたしました…
最近イーガ団が不審な動きをしておりまして…
いやはや面目ございません
インパ様が待っておられます
どうぞ中へお入りください","Though it was simple ignorance, I must
apologize again for my actions.

Lately the Yiga Clan has been stirring up
trouble. We are all on high alert. Still...
That is no excuse for my behavior.
In any case, Lady Impa is waiting.
Please come inside."
13,Talk14,"ご心配には及びません
これはシーカー族に伝わる民族衣装
いつ何時でも任務をこなせるよう
どんな状況にも耐えうるよう作られた物ゆえ
これしきの雨は何ともありませんよ","No need to worry yourself. Upon my
person, I bear the traditional Sheikah
tribe garb.
It is designed to withstand any condition
so that we may always fulfill our duties.
Rain like this is no concern at all."
14,Talk15,"インパ様は それはもう長い間
貴方様を待ち続けておられました
私からも お伝えしたいことはありますが
とにかくまずは インパ様をお訪ねください","Lady Impa has been waiting on you for a
long time.

There is much I would like to tell you
as well... But first, please hurry and see
what Lady Impa has to say."
15,Talk16,"インパ様は それはもう長い間
貴方様を待ち続けておられました
貴方様は我らシーカー族の希望…
さあ早く インパ様をお訪ねください","Lady Impa has been waiting on you for a
long time.

You are the lone hope of the 
Sheikah tribe... Please, hero.
Hurry to Lady Impa's side."
16,Talk17,"はっはっは
そう見えますかな？
シーカー族はかつて自らの英知を
神の力と呼ばれるまでに高めた部族です
この衣装は その当時の技術を
駆使して作られた特注品なのです
どんな天候にも耐えうるよう作られており
雷にやられることもありません
びしょ濡れで重そうに見えますが
着心地は不思議と軽やかなんですよ","Ha! Is that how I appear?


You know... The Sheikah tribe was once
renowned for its technological ingenuity.

There were even those who believed
we had the power of the gods at our
command.
This outfit I wear was specially designed
using that very technology.

It was made to withstand any condition,
including all types of weather. Even a
lightning strike poses no threat.
It may look sopping wet and heavy with
rain, but I assure you, it is dry as a bone
and light beyond reason."
17,Talk18,お…男の人！,A man?!
18,Talk19,"ひぃ…！！

with speaking. As for me, my name is
Pa... Paaa... Paaay...
Oh! My name is Paya!"
20,Talk22,…えっ？それは？！,Huh? Is that—?!
21,Talk23,"ん？それは…
シーカーストーン？
ということは お主…
いや貴方様は もしや…","Hm? 


Is that...a Sheikah Slate?


But that would mean you are...
No, it's not possible. Can it be?"
22,Talk25,"お話はインパ様より伺っております
どうぞ奥にお進みください","Of course we have heard the legends
from Lady Impa herself. Please, friend...
Go ahead and step inside."
23,Talk26,シーカーストーン？！,It's...a Sheikah Slate!
24,Talk27,"もしや貴方様は祖母が話してくれた

25,Talk28,"自分の名前ですから当たり前でしたね…
申し訳ございません
幼き頃より祖母から
貴方様のことは伺っておりました

I'm so...sorry.


Anyway, my grandmother's been awaiting
your return ever since I was little.

Plea...please hurry inside. "
