15,talk00,おはようございます,Good morning.
16,talk01,こんにちは,Good day.
17,talk02,こんばんは,Good evening.
18,talk03,どうも,Hello.
19,talk04,私はリト族の ギザンと申します,I am Gesane of the Rito.
20,talk05,"リトの村なら この橋を渡り切った
先にあります
今はちょっと ゴタゴタしてますけど
店は開いているので是非お立ち寄りください","Rito Village is just across these bridges.


We're all a bit...preoccupied right
now, but I'm sure the shops would
appreciate your business."
21,talk09,テバとはあのテバでしょうか？,Teba? You mean...our Teba?
22,talk10,"彼なら凄い形相で
飛行訓練場の方に向かって行きました
彼の事なので
1人でハーツの仇を取りに行ったんでしょう
リトの戦士御用達の飛行訓練場なら
弾薬も いっぱいあるでしょうし
そこで弓やバクダン矢を
用意してるのかも知れませんね","He stormed off to the Flight Range
with an angry look on his face.

Bit of a loose cannon that one. I'm
guessing he went to get revenge for
Harth by himself.
The Flight Range is where Rito warriors
train for battle.

He probably went there to stock up on
bows and bomb arrows."
23,talk11,"飛行訓練場ならリリトト湖を挟んで真反対の
リノス峠の先です
おっと…リリトト湖を回るなら
東沿いと西沿いで辛さが違いますよ
あなたのようなハイリア人なら…
平坦な西沿いが オススメでしょうか","The Flight Range is beyond
Dronoc's Pass on the other side of
Lake Totori.
If you're going to go around Lake Totori
to get there, there's a big difference
between the east and the west sides.
For a Hylian like yourself...
I'd suggest the west side. It's flatter."
24,talk12,"遠路はるばる ご苦労様です
私に ご用でしょうか？","I imagine you've traveled a long way to
get here. Do you need something?"
25,talk13,こんな寒い土地で すごい格好ですね…,"I'm impressed you're walking around like
that in this weather."
26,talk14,では…,Farewell.
27,talk15,あぁ あなたですか,"Ah, hello again."
28,talk17,はい,Yes.
29,talk18,で私にご用ですか？,Did you need something?
30,talk19,"こないだまで神獣 ヴァ・メドーってのが
暴れてたのですが""最近落ちついたんです","Divine Beast Vah Medoh was kicking
up a storm just a while ago, but he's
calmed down now."
31,talk20,ハイリアのお方ですか？,Are you a Hylian?
32,talk21,これはこれは いい所へ…,You've come at a good time...
33,talk22,"ハイリアの お方ですね？
この悪天候の中 お疲れ様です","You're Hylian, aren't you?
Well done making it here in this weather."
34,talk23,…おっと私にご用でしたっけ？,Hmm? Did you need something?
35,talk24,"そんな事より聞いてください
私見たんです…ガチロックを！","Never mind that. Please listen to this!
I was out for a walk earlier, and I saw...
a Frost Talus!"
36,talk25,降られましたね,"You ever heard of a \""cold shoulder\""?
That's nothing compared to a soggy,
frozen shoulder. Brrrrrr!"
37,talk27,"リリトト湖は この湖の事です

周囲が絶壁だから落ちたら大変です","This is Lake Totori.


As you can see, it's surrounded by steep
cliffs with no way up, so don't go falling
in."
38,talk28,"あなたのようなハイリア人は
尚の事 お気を付け下さい
ワープでもできれば話は別なんですけどね…","A Hylian like yourself should tread
especially carefully. Falling in would
mean certain death.
Unless you could magically travel to
safety, of course, but let's be real."
39,talk29,"ええ全身氷でできた巨像です

野暮用で出かけた時に見かけたんですが…
あれは… すごいですね
ブリザー谷の方でしょうか… とにかく巨大で
少し近づいただけで身の危険を感じましたよ…
昔の英傑様なら あんなのを簡単に
倒せたりするんでしょうか…","Yes! It's a giant monster made of
enchanted ice!

I was out running an errand when I saw
it... It was incredible...and terrifying.
It was incredibly terrifying.
I believe I saw it over in Coldsnap Hollow
before my adrenaline kicked in and I fled
like the wind.
In any case, it was enormous. But I bet a
Champion could have taken it down
no problem."
40,talk30,"ガチロックというのは
全身が氷でできた巨像の事です
ブリザー谷の方で見かけたんですけど
命が惜しいなら近づかない事です
私も一端の戦士ですが
あれには勝てる気がしませんね…","A Frost Talus is a giant made entirely of
enchanted ice. 

I saw one over by Coldsnap Hollow.
If you want to keep breathing, I suggest
you stay far away from there.
I'm pretty good in a fight, but I wouldn't
want to bump into that thing in a dark
valley."
41,talk31,"え？！""ブリザー谷のガチロックを
倒して来たんですか？！
あんな巨大なのを
あなたのようなハイリア人が…
いやでも助かりました あれが村近くに来たら
私が相手しなきゃ なりませんからね…","WHAT?! You defeated the Frost Talus in
Coldsnap Hollow?!

I never would have thought a Hylian
could take down something that big.
No offense.
Well, that's a relief. If that thing had
wandered this way, the entire village
would've been in danger!"
42,talk32,…なので少ないのですが お礼です,"It's not much, but I'd like to reward you
for your trouble."
43,talk33,調子？普通と言った感じです,"How am I? Can't complain, I suppose..."
44,talk34,「普通」と言ったと思いましたが…,Like I said—can't complain.
45,talk35,私に御用でしょうか？,Do you need something?
46,talk36,"ブリザー谷のガチロックを
倒してしまうなんてビックリです","To think you felled the Frost Talus in
Coldsnap Hollow. It boggles the mind."
47,talk37,"メドーも大人しくなったことですし
これでリトの村は安泰ですよ","Medoh is calm now, so Rito Village
should be at peace."
48,talk38,"でも世の中には強いヤツなんて
いくらでも居ますからね
私も精進の毎日です","But this world's chock-full of savage
monsters and terrifying beasts. I must
remain ever vigilant."
49,talk39,他に質問は ございますか？,Do you have any more questions?
50,talk40,ええ…,Yes...
51,talk42,何か ご用でしょうか？,Did you need something?
52,talk43,他に質問は ございますか？,Did you have any more questions?
53,talk44,"「男は弓に女は歌に秀でた
リリトト湖に住む少数民族」","\""The Rito of Lake Totori. Where the men
are fine archers and the women better
singers.\"""
54,talk45,"あなたもハイリア人なら
ご存知かと思いましたが…
まぁ せっかくここまで来られたんですから
村に寄ってってくださいね","You being a Hylian, I'm surprised you
haven't heard that before.

You should visit the village if you get
a chance."
55,talk46,もういいですかね？,Now then...
