風の噂で聞いて この馬宿まで来てみたんだ","Oh, pardon me... I was lost in thought.You've heard of the Great Fairy, right?
The one from all those old stories?

Well, they're not just stories! I believe
the Great Fairy is real! And I'm on a
journey to find her.
There's a tower just beyond the
Tabantha Great Bridge.

They say that if you go to the top and
look at the ground sometime in the
afternoon...
The tower's shadow will point to the
Great Fairy's fountain!

After hearing that legend, I decided to
find out for myself. But now I'm stuck
here at this stable because... Well..."

rupees as an offering for the Great Fairy."

昼過ぎに日が影を落とす方角を見下ろすんだよ

影が落ちる方角くらい わかるよね？
大妖精さまへのおふせ よろしく頼むよ","The shadow of the tower just beyond the
Tabantha Great Bridge will point to the
Great Fairy's fountain in the afternoon.
It'll be pretty hard to see the shadow in
this rain...

But still, I'm counting on you to make
that offering to the Great Fairy!"

And that means, technically, I got to
make my offering to the Great Fairy!
I can't thank you enough!"

僕のところに現れてくれないかな…？","Huh? Um, no, I don't think so... Wait,
