visitor here. Thank you for journeying
to our fair Zora's Domain...
...


Wait a moment... You...
You're Link!

The perpetrator who forced Lady Mipha
to join his crusade 100 years ago,
only to be destroyed by Calamity Ganon!
As though I could ever forget that face.


You should know that the elderly here
who loved Lady Mipha still remember...
and they still resent you.
I, however, resent the deed and not
the person. I also believe in allowing
the mistakes of the past to wash away.
Link...


I have retired from my role as a priest.
I am now living my life free from the
material concerns of this world."

You should come as well. I will start
my preparations in Tarrey Town
in the meantime."

It has been a long while since I last
performed rites like that, so my voice
was a little shrill and nervous.
Hudson and Rhondson are lucky to have
found each other. Clearly they were
guided by Goddess Hylia.
Marriages are made in heaven...
Perhaps you will find your own
partner one day..."
