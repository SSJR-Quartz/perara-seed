ゴロン族としては喜ばしいけど…

兄としては家が壊されるんじゃないかと
心配だゴロス…","Even though we all thought it was just
a child's fairy tale, my brother actually
dug up the secret of the hero.
Now he's so into digging, he'll pretty
much dig anywhere, anytime.

I'm proud, but I'm also his big brother.
I can't let him beat me! I'll have to stop
skippin' leg day and train harder!
As a fellow Goron, of course I'm
thrilled about it...

But as a brother, I'm mostly just worried
our house is gonna get all dug up
between the two of us..."

...Ah! That's right!

Well, the shock of seeing the secret of
the hero dug up totally cured me!

The secret of the hero is amazing!
Unbelievable!

near the city..."

あんたのことを語り継ぐでゴロス！","I'll never forget the debt I owe you for
all this, brother. Not in my entire life!
