9,talk00,"その火…不思議な色…
故郷の漁火とも違っていて…","What a strangely colored fire...
It's almost like an anglerfish's lure."
10,talk01,"その火の色… 
見つめていると吸い込まれそうね～…","That fire is mesmerizing. I shouldn't stare
any longer or I'll get sucked in."
11,talk02,お話ができて楽しかったさ～,It was nice talking with you.
12,talk03,ふふ…,Heehee...

16,talk07,"同じ雨でも高地に降る雨は
また違った感じだね～…","I know it's all the same, more or less,
but the rain feels different on your skin
the higher you go."
17,talk08,"心地よい風…
潮の香りは しないけどさ～…","What a nice breeze... It doesn't carry
that tang of salt on it, though."
18,talk09,"これんこと？

ハテノ古代研究所の所長さんが
青い火を灯すしょく台らしいけど
じつは私…こちらに嫁いできてから
所長さんのお姿を一度も見てないんさ～","Oh, you've noticed these, have you?It's apparently one of the lanterns
that the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab's
director lights with the blue flame...
But if there's still a director there, I've
never seen her. Not even once since
moving here after my marriage."
19,talk10,"明るいうちは
主人の代わりに風車の番をしてるんさ～
風車が一定の速度で回り続けないと
粉のツブがそろわないんだ！
…って仕事に厳しい主人さね

私にはやさしいんだけどね～
ふふふ…","I take care of the windmills during the
day in place of my husband.The windmills have to turn at the right
speed, or we can't grind the flour!My husband is very particular when it
comes to our work. But I take a more
freewheeling attitude toward it."
20,talk11,"私は そろそろ睡眠を…
またの機会にさね","I'm getting ready for bed now. Why don't
we talk tomorrow?"
21,talk12,"あっ ごめんちゃん
初対面の方に おかしなお話ししてさ～…
じつは私の故郷であるウオトリー村の
海辺の暮らしを思い出してたんさ～
ここハテノ村は景色も匂いも違うけど
私の愛する人を育んだ素敵な土地…
主人と二人で働けて すごく幸せさね","Oops! I forgot we just met.I was reminiscing about my hometown
of Lurelin Village by the sea.The view and the air are different here
in Hateno Village, but this is where my
wonderful husband calls home.
I count myself lucky to be able to live
and work alongside such a wonderful,
loving man."
22,talk13,他にも用かいさ～？,Can I help you with anything else?
23,talk14,"ごめんちゃん
今から寝るわいさ～…","I'm sorry, but I should go get ready
for bed now."
24,talk15,何か用かいさ～？,What is it?
25,talk16,"今から お仕事さね
風と風車を見つづける素敵なお仕事…","It'll be time for work soon. I have a lovely
job that lets me sit here, watch the
windmills, and feel the breeze in my hair."
26,talk17,"私今からお仕事だけどね～

座ってから お話しするわいさ～","I'll be starting work soon. Are you wondering what I do? Heehee...
I'll tell you all about it once I can sit."
27,talk18,今の時間は主人に…むにゃ,It's so late... Husband's turn now... Zzz...
28,talk19,う…ん,Mm...
29,talk20,"これはハテノ古代研究所の所長さんが
青い火を灯すしょく台らしいね～
私はこれを見張ってるわけじゃなくて
たまたま ここに座ってるだけなんさ～
こちらに嫁いで間もないので
よくわからんちゃん","They say this lantern needs blue
flame from the director at the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.
Oh, but I'm not guarding it. I'm just
sitting here watching the windmill.I was married recently and moved here
to my husband's hometown, so I can't
tell you much more than that."
30,talk21,"もし気になるんなら
所長さんに直接聞くといいわいさ～","If you're curious, why not head up the
road and pay a visit to the director?"
31,talk22,"風車が止まると粉がひけんので
主人と交代で見張ってるんさ～
こうしていると世の中が平和だと
つい錯覚してしまうさね～","The windmills have to keep turning, so
my husband and I watch them in shifts.It's a pleasant job. Sitting here and
watching the world go by makes it
feel like a very peaceful place."
32,talk23,"このハテノ村から はるか南にある
小さな漁村さ～
私そのウオトリー村から嫁いできた
ロレルっていうわいさ～
嫁入り道具と一緒にハイリア大橋を渡って…
思えば ずいぶん遠くまで来たんさね～","It's a small fishing community far to
the south. I lived there before I moved
here with my new husband.
We had to cross the Bridge of Hylia to
get here, weighted down with everything
I couldn't bear to leave behind.
Thinking back on it, it's a wonder either
of us survived the trip..."
33,talk24,"ウオトリー村はハイリア大橋を渡って
さらに歩いた先にある小さな漁村さ～
こちらに嫁いできてから
まだ一度も里帰りしてないさ～…
私の父…変わらず元気で
イカダ漁に精を出してるとは思うけどね～…","Lurelin Village is a small fishing
town on the south side of the
Bridge of Hylia.
I haven't been back there yet since
I moved here after the wedding.I wonder if Father is still healthy enough
to go raft fishing..."
