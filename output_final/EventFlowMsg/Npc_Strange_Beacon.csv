You have a satisfied look on your face,
like you've accomplished something
and are all proud of it and stuff.
Wish I knew what it was like to have
that look...

Well, anyway. To show off the fruits of my
training, I'm going to tell you all about

失敗することもあるし…""料理は奥深いな…","Even when I use ingredients I'm certain
will be perfect, there are lots of times I
still mess it up. Cooking is complicated."
