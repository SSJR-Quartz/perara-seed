12,talk00,"おぉ青い炎！""久しぶりに見たなぁ

プルアさんは元気でしたか？
最近見ないので みんな心配してたんですよ","The blue flame! I haven't seen that
in quite a while! How is Purah?

We haven't seen her lately, so we've all
been a little worried about her."
13,talk01,"青い炎ですか…
そういえばプルアさんしばらく見てないなぁ","It's been a while since I saw Purah
carrying around that blue flame..."
14,talk02,"おや旅の人ですかな？

私が このハテノ村の村長 クサヨシです
のどかな村でしょう？","Oh, are you an adventurer? I am the
head of Hateno Village. Call me Reede.

Isn't this a peaceful place we have here,
don't you think?"
15,talk03,"ええ…""大厄災の傷も癒え
これから という感じですね","Yes... We're finally feeling a bit of 
recovery from the Great Calamity."
16,talk04,"ハハハ…
あなたにはこの村が都会に見えますかな？
確かにハテノ村は ずいぶん人が増えました…
大厄災直後には想像もできなかったでしょう","Haha! This village looks like an urban
center to you, eh?

Well, Hateno Village has definitely grown
in size recently now that we're
recovering from the Great Calamity."
17,talk05,"まぁ ここは食べ物も豊富ですし
心ゆくまで くつろいでってください","Our village is pleasant, peaceful, and has
plenty of food to go around! Please stay
as long as you'd like."
18,talk06,はいはい,"Yes, yes..."
19,talk07,おはようございます,Mornin'!
20,talk08,こんにちは,Hullo!

22,talk10,グオォ～…グオォ～…,Zzz... Zzz...
23,talk12,どうなさいましたか？,Can I help you with anything?
24,talk13,はいはい さようなら,"Yes, yes. Good-bye."
25,talk14,"大厄災とは口にするのもおぞましい
100年前に起こった惨事の呼び名です
世界の村は焼かれ それは水も焦げるほど…
多くの人々が命を奪われました
とは言っても私の産まれる前の話なので
年輩の方が お詳しいでしょうね","It's hard to even talk about the
Great Calamity. It was a disastrous event
that took place 100 years ago.
Villages everywhere were burned. Many
lives were lost...

That was all before I was born, of course.
The elders here would know more."
26,talk15,"大厄災の戦火をくぐり抜け
ハイリア人の手で復興を遂げたのがハテノ村です
今では人や店も増え
あなたのような旅人も多くなってきました
そういう意味では ここは平和と言えましょう","Hateno Village barely survived the
Great Calamity. The village was later
rebuilt by Hylian hands.
Now many people live here in peace
amongst the shops. It's nice to see
travelers stop by now and then as well."
27,talk16,"ハテノ古代研究所…？

あぁ…小高い丘にある建物の事ですね","Hateno Ancient Tech Lab? Oh, sure!
That's the building up on the top
of that hill.
A person from the Sheikah tribe lives up
there. You never know what they're
diving into.
They rarely come out lately, now that I
think about it. They must be really
busy lately..."
28,talk17,"おぉ青い炎！""久しぶりに見たなぁ

所長さんは元気でしたか？
最近見ないので みんな心配してたんですよ","Oh, the blue flame! I haven't seen that
in quite a while.

How was the director? We haven't
seen the lab folks in a bit, so some
of us were getting a little worried..."
29,talk18,"青い炎ですか…
そういえば所長さんしばらく見てないなぁ","It's been a while since I saw the
director carrying around that
blue flame..."
30,talk19,雨ですな,Yup. Rainin'.
31,talk20,雨は止みそうにありませんね,"Don't think the rain's gonna let up
anytime soon."
32,talk21,落ち着いたところで お話しましょうか…,Why don't we chat somewhere nicer?
33,talk22,他に聞きたい事は ありますかな？,Anything else you wanna ask?
34,talk23,"あそこには大厄災の当時から
シーカー族の方が住んでおられましてね
研究と称して""何かをされているみたいですよ

しかし最近 お二人とも
めっきり外出されてないご様子…
ちょっと心配では ありますね…","Seems at least one member of the
Sheikah tribe has lived up there since
the time of the Great Calamity.
They call what goes on up there
research, but I don't know what kind.

Those folks up there should get out
more, y'know? It's not healthy to stay
cooped up all day!"
35,talk24,"ハテノ古代研究所なら
東の小高い丘の上にあります","If you're looking for the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab,
it's atop the small hill to the east."
