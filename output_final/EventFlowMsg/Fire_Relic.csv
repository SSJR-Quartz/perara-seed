18,talk00,こんなトコまで何しに来たコロ？,"But what brought you all the way
out here to begin with?"
19,talk01,"あ そうなんだ！
組長にボクを探すよう頼まれたのかな？
ハァ～～～…なんにせよ助かったコロ…","Oh! So that's it! Boss told you to come
find me!

Phew, thank goodness. In any case,
I sure am glad you saved me, goro!"
20,talk100,"さっき テレパシーを送ってくれたみたいだけど
ボクは何も感じなかったコロよ？","I think your telepathic signals may be
crossed or malfunctioning, goro.
I don't seem to be reading you."
21,talk102,だからウィンクは離れたら見えないコロ…,"I'm tellin' you, I won't be able to see
a wink from that far away, goro!"
22,talk103,ちょ…ちょっと！どこ行くコロ？！,"Hey! Where you going, goro?!"
23,talk104,ルーダニアに乗り込むの あきらめるコロ？,"You really wanna give up tryin' to
board Rudania, goro?"
24,talk105,分かった…じゃ また行くコロ！,"OK then, goro. Let's get goin' again!"
25,talk106,"了解…準備が出来たら
またここまで来て欲しいコロ","Oh, OK. I get it. When you're ready,
please just come back here, goro."
26,talk108,"組長はこっちゴロ！
ついて来るゴロ！","Boss is over here, goro!
Come with me!"
27,talk109,"組長がキミに話があるって…
何の話かなぁ…","Boss has somethin' he wants to talk to
you about. I wonder what it is, goro..."
28,talk110,さぁ！組長のお話しを聞くゴロよ！,"OK! Let's hear what Boss has
to say, goro!"
29,talk111,"組長の話って何ゴロ？
直接聞いてみてゴロ","What did Boss want, goro?
You should ask him directly!"
30,talk114,さぁ早く大砲の準備をするコロよ！,"OK. Let's hurry up and prepare
the cannon, goro!"
31,talk115,うう…ヒザが震えちゃうコロ…,"Yeesh... My knees are shaking, goro..."
32,talk116,慎重に行くコロよ…,"We need to tread lightly, goro..."
33,talk117,次の大砲…次の大砲…,Next cannon... Next cannon...
34,talk118,ここまでは いつも通りコロ…,"OK. It's not too terribly different from
usual so far, goro."
35,talk119,よ～し… この調子コロ…,"OK. We just need to keep going, goro."
36,talk120,あと少しで…追っ払えそうコロ…,"Just a little more and we can drive
it off, goro..."
37,talk121,ミギャ－！助けてー！,"Yaah! Someone, please help me!"
38,talk122,"わぉ！キミ強いコロね！
また助けられたコロ！","WOW! You're crazy strong, goro!
You saved me again!"
39,talk123,"でもね""神獣がこっちへ来ないように
組長がオルディン橋を上げてるコロよ…
ルーダニアのとこに行くには
あのオルディン橋を架けないといけないコロ
いつもは組長が この大砲で
橋を倒してくれるんだけど…","The problem is...good ol' Boss raised the
Bridge of Eldin to make sure that mean
Divine Beast couldn't get over here.
In order to get to where Rudania is,
we'll have to find a way to get the
Bridge of Eldin back down, goro.
Boss would normally use the cannon
to lower it... Ugh, we can't get across
unless we figure somethin' out!"
40,talk13,"う～ん…

……

よく見たら ハイリア人コロ…

ひょっとして キミが岩を壊してくれたコロ？
どうも ありがとコロ！","Hmm...


HMMM...


Now that I've gotten a good look...
Whoa! It's a Hylian!

Were you the one who broke through
that crag to rescue me, goro?
Thanks, brother!"
41,talk143,"ミギャー！助けてー！
怖いコロー！","Eek! Help meeee!
I'm scared, goro!"
42,talk144,"あわ…あわ…
偵察機が邪魔で先へ進めないコロ…
困ったコロ…
進むには どうしたらいいコロ…
何か方法は ありそうだけど…","Uh-oh. Yikes, goro. We can't keep goin'
with those sentries in the way...

What should we do? How can we
possibly move forward?

There must be a way, goro..."
43,talk148,"ボクが そのユン
みんなからはユン坊って言われてるコロ","The name's Yunobo. Everyone calls me...
Yunobo. Makes sense, goro."
44,talk149,"組長の痛み止めを取りに来たら
火山弾で岩が崩れて閉じ込められちゃってね…","I came to get some painkillers for Boss,
but a magma bomb caused a rock slide,
sealing the entrance, goro."
45,talk151,"そう言えば キミ…
どうやって入口の岩を壊したコロ？","By the way... How did you break those
rocks at the entrance, goro?"
46,talk152,"ええ～！組長の大砲使ったコロ？！

アレ使うの難し過ぎて
組長以外使いこなせないコロよ！","Huh? You used Boss's cannon?!


That thing is so difficult to use. I thought
only Boss could handle it!"
47,talk153,"あっ…おしゃべりしてる場合じゃないコロ
早く痛み止め届けなきゃ…
悪いけど ボク もう行くコロ
後で組長のところに来て！
ああ見えて組長は義理堅いコロよ
きっとお礼をくれるコロ！
じゃあねぇ～","Oops, I nearly forgot! This isn't the time to chat...
I need to deliver these painkillers as soon
as possible!
Sorry, I've gotta run! But do come by and
see the Boss later, OK? He may be gruff,
but he always repays a favor.
I'm sure there's a reward in it for you.
OK then! Good-bye for now, goro!"
48,talk154,"せっかく取りに行ったのに…
あの痛み止め効かなかったコロか…
組長が来れないなら仕方ないコロね
いったん帰るコロ…","After we went through all that trouble to
get them...the painkillers didn't even
end up working, goro.
Well, if Boss can't help, there's nothin'
else we can do. I suppose I'll just head
back now..."
49,talk155,え帰らないの？なんで？,"Huh? You're not goin' back?!
But why, goro?"
50,talk156,"ええっ！あの神獣に乗り込む？！

なにダルケル様みたいな事言ってるコロ！
中に入るなんて危ないコロよ
弱らせたら入れるかもしれないけど…

でも… どうして？","WHAT?! You're gonna try to board
the Divine Beast?

Who do you think you are...Lord Daruk?
It's dangerous in there, goro!

Though I guess if you weakened it first,
it might be possible...

But...why risk it?!"
51,talk158,"ふ～ん… よく分かんないけど
キミにも事情があるコロね…","Hmm. Well, I don't really get it, but I'm
sure you have your reasons, goro..."
52,talk159,"組長が来れないなら
大砲で橋も架けれないし無理コロよ！","If Boss can't come down here, then he
can't use the cannon to lower the bridge.
That means we're out of luck, goro!"
53,talk16,"よーし…早く橋を渡るコロよ
ドキドキ…","OK! Here we go!
Gosh, I'm nervous...goro."
54,talk160,"あっ…！そう言えば キミ
組長の大砲使えるコロね？
だったら行けるかも…","Oh! It occurs to me that YOU know how
to use the cannons! Don't you, goro?

Maybe we CAN get across after all..."
55,talk162,"だったら いつも組長とやってるように
ボクが弾になるからキミが撃って欲しいコロ！","So let's just do what I do to help Boss
sometimes. That means I'm gonna be the
cannonball! And you'll launch me, goro!"
56,talk163,"助けてくれて ありがとコロ！！
キミが来てくれなかったら危なかったコロよ…
ふぅ…
それにしても組長 まだかなぁ…","Thanks for savin' me, brother! I would've
been in real trouble if you hadn't shown
up when you did, goro.
*sigh* Still no sign of Boss, eh?"
57,talk164,"えぇ！""中止？！
どうしてぇ？！","Huh? Not coming? But why, goro?!"
58,talk165,"ボクにはこの ご先祖様譲りの
ダルケルの護りが あるからね！
これだと何にぶつかっても
全く痛くないコロよ！","I've got Daruk's Protection, goro!
My ancestor's help can't possibly
fail me!
That means I can smash into anything
and it won't hurt one bit, goro!"
59,talk166,"ボクのご先祖のダルケル様は
それはそれは凄い人だった！
…って組長が言ってたコロ

ボクはそのダルケル様と同じ
ダルケルの護りを使えるんだからね！","My ancestor, Daruk, was a big deal, goro.
That's what Boss says, so it's just gotta
be true!
And I can use Daruk's Protection just like
Daruk could! That means there's no need
to worry, goro!"
60,talk167,"だからキミは大船に乗ったつもりで
オルディン橋を狙って撃つだけでいいコロ！
でも手加減は して欲しいコロ…","So rest easy, got it? Well, go on then!
Take aim at the Bridge of Eldin and
fire away, goro!
Just, y'know...be kinda gentle about it..."
61,talk168,あわ…あわ…,Owww... OUCH...
62,talk169,こいつら倒してー！,Take 'em out!
63,talk17,"神獣 ヴァ・ルーダニア…
今日も やったるコロ…","The Divine Beast Vah Rudania...
is out causing trouble again."
64,talk170,ひぃぃ～～！,Eeeeek!
65,talk171,"あのね さっきボク
ルーダニアの上に立つダルケル様を見たんだよ！
あれは…まぼろしだったのかなぁ？

でも なんだか少し勇気が湧いてきたゴロ！","Ya know... While I was up there, I coulda
sworn I saw Lord Daruk standin' on top
of Rudania!
I wonder... Was that his ghost?!


I dunno how to explain it, but somehow
I feel a lot braver now, goro!"
66,talk172,"ボクは キミの指示に従うコロ
口笛で指示して欲しいコロ","I'll follow your instructions—promise!
Just whistle to let me know what
I need to do, goro."
67,talk173,"キミが口笛を吹く度に
ボクは進んだり止まったりするからね","Each time you whistle, I'll either stop or
start moving accordingly. OK?"
68,talk18,"オルディン橋""架かったコロ…
さぁ""早く橋を渡るコロよ","The Bridge of Eldin is down...
OK! Let's get across quickly, goro!"
69,talk19,"ご先祖様のダルケルの護りは凄いコロ！
さぁ""早く橋を渡るコロよ","My ancestor's power, Daruk's Protection,
is amazing! OK then. Let's get across
that bridge quickly, goro!"
70,talk49,"さぁ後はキミに任せたコロよ
ボクはここから見守ってるコロ
もし何か準備が足りないなら
一度ゴロンシティに帰るといいコロ","OK, I'll leave the rest to you.
I'll be watching from here, goro.

If you feel like you need to prepare a bit
more, you can always return to town."
71,talk51,"あっ キミ？！
飛び込んだんじゃなかったコロ？！
でもまだルーダニアは下で生きてるみたいコロ
また復活したらヤだなー…
何とかしないとだけど
この高さを飛び降りるのは ボクには無理コロ…","Hey, it's you! But... Wait... Didn't you
jump down? I coulda sworn you did...

Anyway, it looks like Rudania is still
active down there.

I really don't want him gettin' back up,
goro. We've gotta do somethin'!

But there's no way I'd survive if I jumped
down from this high up, goro..."
72,talk52,"やぁ！ キミィ！
ルーダニアを鎮めてくれて ありがとゴロ！","Hey! Brother! Thanks so much for
appeasing Rudania, goro!"
73,talk53,"あっ そうだ！

組長に キミの事話したら
「連れて来い」って言われてたゴロ！
組長の命令は絶対ゴロ！
早く来るゴロ！","Oh! That's right!


I talked to Boss about you, and he said
to bring you to him!

An order from Boss can't be refused.
Move it, goro!"
74,talk58,"キミがルーダニアの中で
何してたのかは知らないけど
アイツ…
すっかり おとなしくなっちゃったゴロよ","I don't exactly know what you were doin'
in Rudania, but...

Well...it seems to have calmed down,
goro!"
75,talk66,さぁ早く橋を渡るコロよ！,"Let's hurry and cross the bridge, goro!"
76,talk94,"あわ…あわ…
いつも あの偵察機が やっかいコロよ…
あれに見つかるとルーダニアが暴れて
デスマウンテンを噴火させるコロ…
ボク…いつもすぐ見つかっちゃって
何度も火山弾""降らしちゃうコロ…
組長なら火山弾を振り払って強引に行くけど
キミが喰らうと イチコロコロ
迷惑かけたくないし
止まるか進むか ボクに合図を出して欲しいコロ","Oh... Yikes... A sentry is always a
nuisance, no matter where it is or
how many of them there are.
If one finds you, Rudania will go nuts,
which will cause Death Mountain
to erupt, goro.
I...always get spotted, and then
magma bombs come raining down
one after another.
If Boss were here, he'd swat those
magma bombs away like they were
nothin' and force his way up!
I don't think you'd be able to do that,
goro. And I don't wanna cause you
any trouble. Hmmm...
Maybe the best idea is for you to give me
a signal to let me know when I should
stop and when I can move forward."
77,talk95,"じゃ その合図を決めるコロ
何かいい方法 あるコロ？","Let's hurry and decide what the signal
will be, goro! Um, got any ideas?"
78,talk96,"う…ウィンク？！

ウィンクなんて離れてたら見えないコロよ！
もっといい方法考えるコロ！","A wink? Ummm...


Yeaaaah, I don't think I'd be able to see
that from way off in the distance, goro.
Try to think of somethin' better!"
79,talk98,"わぉ！テレパシー？！

最近のハイリア人は
テレパシー使えるコロ？！
ん…

…

…まだかな？

…

ちょっと！何も感じないコロ！","Mind powers?! Wow! You mean, like,
real-life telepathy?

I didn't know you Hylians could do that
sort of thing these days!

...
Are you transmitting yet, goro?
...
What the? I'm not receiving anything
over here!"
80,talk99,"口笛？な なるほどコロー！

キミの口笛が聞こえたらボクは
止まったり進んだりしたら いいコロね！
ちょっと お馬さんみたいで アレだけど…

じゃ ボクが偵察機に見つからないよう
口笛で合図よろしくコロ！","A whistle? Ah, that's a great idea, goro!


When I hear your whistle, I'll either stop
in my tracks or start moving forward!
I like it!
Even though it's kinda like calling a horse, goro...


OK then. I'm counting on you and your
whistles to make sure I'm not spotted
by those awful sentries!"
