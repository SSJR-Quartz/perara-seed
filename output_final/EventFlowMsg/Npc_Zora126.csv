水のバケモノが危ないから ダメだって…","I need to go to the Bank of Wishes to
send a letter...but Mother won't let me
go because of that water monster."
11,talk02,私もう子供じゃないのに…,"She treats me like I'm still a child.
It's sooo condescending.

It's really terrible to be at that awkward
Zora age where I'm a young woman
but I haven't had my growth spurt yet.
Just my luck to be a late bloomer.
I'll probably NEVER grow taller.
Ugh, it's awful to be me sometimes.
I doubt Hylians have to deal with
nonsense like this since you age
so fast. You're so lucky."
