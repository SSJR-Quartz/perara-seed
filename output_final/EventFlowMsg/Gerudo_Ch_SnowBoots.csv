ほ ほんとにあったの？",WHAAAAAT?! It really exists?!
11,Talk_00,"ゲルド高地でキミを見たって人がいてね
心配していたんだよ！
まさかスノーブーツなしで
あんな場所に行くなんて思ってなかったからさ…
それより大丈夫だったかい？","A traveler swore he saw you in the
Gerudo Highlands, so I've been gnawing
on my fingernails with worry!
I mean, all that talk about the sword was
just chitchat... I didn't think you'd go up
there without snow boots!
Anyway, are you OK?"
12,Talk_02,"それにしてもスノーブーツなしで
剣を探し出すなんて…
ゲルド高地は男の僕だって
無事ではすまない険しいところなのに… 
キミは一体
何者なんだ…","And you went searching for it without
a decent pair of snow boots...

I mean, the Gerudo Highlands are
unforgiving. I doubt I could survive
there, and I'm burly.
Who ARE you?!"
13,Talk_03,"…そうだな
命がけで約束を果たしてくれたんだもんな
男の僕が彼女との約束を
やぶるわけにはいかないよな","Yeah... You did risk your life to fulfill
your promise, after all...

It'd be pretty uncouth of me to drop my 
end of the bargain."
14,Talk_04,"とうとう裸足になっちゃったよ…

でもキミが喜んでくれるなら
それも本望さ！
それに今回でキミの大切さが
改めて分かったんだ！
その欲張りなところ…
時にそっけないところ…
意外とタフなところ…

あの…

よかったら…

ぼぼぼ""僕と

つつつ""付き合って…","Well, now I'm barefoot...


But if you're happy, then I'm happy!


And what's more, this whole episode
has endeared you even more to me!

Your cutely greedy side. Your sassy,
playfully rude side...

Your unexpectedly tough side...


Um...


Would you...


...g-g-go out...


...w-w-w-with..."
15,Talk_05,"なんだ男かよ…

しっかし まぁ
冴えない顔してるねぇ…
そんなんじゃ
彼女できないよ～
おっとご免よ
ちょっと上から目線になっちゃったかな
僕も女の子とは色々あったけど
今は彼女一筋なんだ！
悪いけど僕は今男性はもちろん
女性でも彼女以外は眼中にないんでね
何か用があるなら
他の人を あたってくれるかな？","Oh, it's just a guy...


But...hm. Listen, pal, a little free advice?
You're looking pretty sour.

You keep walking around looking like
a grouch, and you'll never get a girl. 

Aw, what am I saying? Sorry about that.
Awfully condescending of me.

I've just got wooing on the brain.
Girls have always vexed me, but right
now SHE is all I can think of!
Sorry, but I don't even have time for
other GIRLS right now, let alone other
guys, know what I mean?
If you need something, do me a favor...
Ask someone else."
16,Talk_06,"んぁっ！！

サ サヴォッタ！

って","Gah!


S-sav'otta!


Wait."
17,Talk_07,"だからさぁ…

僕は今彼女以外に興味がないんだ
何か用があるなら
他の人をあたってくれないかな？","Like I said...


I'm not interested in talking to anyone
but HER. She is all things to me!
If you need something...
be a pal and ask someone else, huh?"
18,Talk_08,"んぁっ！！

サ サヴォッタ！

って また君？","Gaaaah!


S-sav'otta!


Wait. You again?"
19,Talk_09,"なんだ君か…

しっかし まぁ""相変わらず
冴えない顔してるねぇ…
そんなんじゃ

何か用があるなら
他の人を あたってくれるかな？","Oh, it's just you...


But...huh. Look, I feel like someone 
should tell you that you have kind of a
sulky look about you.
You keep walking around looking all
miserable, and you'll never get a girl. 

Aw, what am I saying? Sorry about that.
Awfully condescending of me.

I've just got wooing on the brain.

20,Talk_10,"キミ！！

来てくれたんだね！
いや きっと来ると思ってたよ！
この前は ゆっくりお話しできなかったけど
よかったら今日は二人っきりで…","You!


You came! I mean, hey, yeah, of course.
Figured you'd swing by. Yup. 
Do the ol' swing-by.
We didn't get a chance to spend much
time together earlier, did we? Whoosh!
Total whirlwind! So...wanna hang out?"
21,Talk_11,"キミ！！

来てくれたんだね！
いや きっと来ると思ってたよ！
それに さっそくサンドブーツも
履いてくれてるんだね
男性物の靴だったから
キミに合うかどうか心配だったんだけど
すごく似合ってるよ！

この前は ゆっくりお話しできなかったけど
よかったら今日は二人っきりで…","You!


You came back! I mean, yeah. Heyyyyy.
Course you came by. What's up?

And look at you, wearing those
sand boots already like a...saucy little
pink heron or something.
Y'know, gotta say, they're designed for
burly men like myself, so I was worried
they wouldn't fit such a flower as you...
But they look absolutely fantastic!


Gosh! Anyway, I realized we never really
got a chance to chat earlier, so you want
to grab a spot somewhere and hang out?"
22,Talk_12,"えっ？

スノーブーツも欲しいの？","What?


You want my snow boots, too?"
23,Talk_13,"はは…
キミは意外と欲張りさんなんだね
でも これがなくなっちゃうと
僕履く物がなくなっちゃうし…","Ha! Well aren't we greedy!
Or should I say insatiable for boots.
A boot thirst that cannot be slaked!
Adorable. But listen, if I give you these,
then I'll have nothing for my feet!"
24,Talk_14,"ど どうしよう…
ここで彼女の機嫌を損ねたくないし…
よし…
今度もあの手で行こう…","Oh, man, what should I do? THINK, Bozai!
Can't put her in a bad mood...

OK... Do NOT blow this. Just relax and work a little
verbal magic..."
25,Talk_15,"そうだね～
キミの頼みじゃ断れないよな
ただ前みたいにまた
僕を驚かしてくれたら
キミに このスノーブーツを
プレゼントしようじゃないか！","How could I resist a request from you?


No lie, you really gave me a surprise
earlier...and I love surprises.
Surprise me again like that...
and I'll give you these snow boots as a
surprise present!"
26,Talk_16,"実は あの八人目の英雄の巨像…
剣を持っていなかったのに気付いたかい？
他の七人の英雄の巨像は
全員剣を持っているのにだよ
きっと八人目の英雄にも剣があったはずなんだ

この剣が本当に存在するのであれば
こんなに驚くことはないよ！","So let me ask you this: Did you notice
that the statue of the eighth heroine...
isn't actually holding a sword?
Pretty weird, right? Seven other
heroines, they all have their swords!
Suspicious, y'know?
Which leads me to deduce that the
eighth heroine must have had a
sword as well. Must have!
To see that such a sword actually
exists, that my deduction is right...
There could be no greater surprise!"
27,Talk_17,"えっ？行くの？

あの巨像がもつ剣だから
そんなに遠くへは運べないと思うし
たぶん あの険しいゲルド高地の
どこかだと思うよ？","What? You're really going?


Wow, all right, then. The sword would be
pretty big, so I doubt it could have been
carried off too far.
I'm betting it's probably somewhere in
the steeps of the Gerudo Highlands."
28,Talk_18,"今度はスノーブーツ
貸してあげられないよ？","And the thing is, I can't lend you the
snow boots this time. Just can't do it!
I'm really sorry."
29,Talk_19,"まぁ… スノーブーツなしで普通の女の子が
ゲルド高地に登れるわけないし…
途中であきらめて帰ってくるよな…","No way a normal person can make it through the
Gerudo Highlands without good snow boots...

She'll probably give up halfway through and come
crawling back..."
30,Talk_20,"わかったよ
キミには負けたよ
じゃあ僕はここで待ってるね

でもスノーブーツとか関係なく
僕に用がある時は いつでも声かけてね！","Fine, you win. So headstrong!
I love it.

I'll just be waiting here, OK?


If you ever need me for anything above
and beyond footwear, you just come find
ol' Bozai anytime!"
31,Talk_21,"そう そう
スノーブーツになんかこだわらず
僕と二人っきりでデートでも…","I hear you! Better to think about crazy
snow-boot quests than actually do 'em,
am I right?
Instead, how about you and I retire to
someplace a bit more private and learn
about how witty we both no doubt are?"
32,Talk_22,やっぱり…,Knew it...
33,Talk_23,"き今日も相変わらず
きききき きれいだね
よかったら これから二人っきりで…","Y-you look as b-b-b-b-beautiful as ever.


If you're not doing anything, how about
we grab a spot of sand and chitchat?"
34,Talk_24,"えっ でもさ

八人目の英雄の剣があるのは
たぶんゲルド高地だよ？","Huh? But...


Remember the sword of the eighth
heroine? Probably somewhere in the
Gerudo Highlands?"
35,Talk_25,"スノーブーツも
貸してあげられないよ？","So sorry, but proof of that sword is the
price of these sweet snow boots."
36,Talk_26,"あっ サンドブーツ履いてくれてる！
かわいいなぁ…
あっ ごめんごめん
あまりにも可愛くて見とれちゃってたよ
よかったら これから二人っきりで…","Oh! She's wearing the sand boots!
Advantage, Bozai...

Ah, sorry, sorry. You just look so 
precious in those sand boots.
My mind just went POOF!
If you'd like, why don't we grab a spot
by a tree and get to know each other?"
37,Talk_27,キキミ！！,Y-you!
38,Talk_28,"うう…""薄々はわかってたけど…
せめて最後まで言わせてほしかった","Urk... I kind of knew you'd say that...
but would it have killed you to let me
finish the question?"
39,Talk_29,"あれっ？
でも キミ荷物がいっぱいじゃないか
欲張りな女の子は好きだけど
それじゃあ渡せないよ…
荷物の整理ができたら
また声をかけてよ
僕は ここでキミをずっと
待ってるからさ！","Huh? But your bag is full.


I think it's adorable that you want MORE
boots even with so many other clothing
options, but you need storage space.
Come talk to me again once you've
organized your bag, OK?

I'll be waiting!"
40,Talk_30,"本当に八人目の英雄の剣を見つけてくるなんて
今でもまだ信じられないぐらい驚いてるよ…
でも また僕たちの秘密が増えたね…

やっぱり僕らは運命で結ばれ…","I'm still so flabbergasted that the eighth
heroine's sword actually exists...
I can hardly believe it...
And you and I share this secret, along
with so many other meaningful and
romantic exchanges...
We must be connected by dest—"
41,Talk_33,"えっ？
まさか本当に行くわけじゃないよな…？
これは僕の予想なんだけど…

八人目の英雄像が持ってる剣だから
かなり大きいと思うんだ
だから遠くに運んだりもできないから
ゲルド高地にあるって僕は思ってるんだ
でも あの辺りは険しいだけじゃなく
凶悪な魔物もいるから
ゲルド族の人達でも行かない って聞いてるよ
怖い場所だよね…
それよりさ… そんな危険な所へ行くよりも
僕と二人で お茶でも…","Huh? She's not seriously considering going to
look for it, is she? That's crazy talk.

Well, this is just the result of my own
deductions, but...

The statue of the eighth heroine is huge,
right? So it stands to reason that the 
sword would be too.
That's why I think it wouldn't be possible
for anyone to carry it far. And THAT is
why it must be in the Gerudo Highlands.
But look, the terrain is treacherous 
enough by itself, and then you also have
nasty monsters to deal with.
I heard that many Gerudo don't even
dare set foot there. The place is
legitimately scary.
So...instead of opting for scary...
Why don't you and I opt for romantic
and maybe even a little risqué?"
42,Talk_34,さ… さよなら…,G-good-bye...
43,Talk_35,"きょ今日も可愛いね

それにしても君がそんなにスノーブーツを
気に入っていたなんて知らなかったよ…
で でもさ僕がスノーブーツをはいて
キミを抱きかかえて歩けば
キミがスノーブーツをはく必要はないよね…","Y-you look stunning today, too.


I have to say, your insatiable craving for
these snow boots fascinates me.

But I hate the idea of you trekking in
them out in the dangerous wilds...
So I had a brilliant idea!
I could just keep the boots on and
CARRY you around! Then you wouldn't
need to wear them! How about it?"
44,Talk_36,次…こそ… は… デ… ト… に…,"Next time... For sure... We will...go on...
a da...date..."
45,near00,次こそデートに誘うぞ,"Next time, maximum woo!"
