珍しいモン被ってるじゃないかい？
次は アンタが盗人にでも
なったのかい？
ふっふ…
冗談さ…
アタシがまだ宮殿にいた頃 
先代様がそれを被ってねぇ
まだ小さな ルージュ様に
一生懸命何かの言葉を伝えてらっしゃったよ
懐かしいねぇ…

それはゲルド族の宝でもあり
族長様の想い出の品でもあるんだ
どういった経緯で手に入れたかは知らんが
大切に扱うんだよ","...That's quite an unusual thing you're
wearing on your head, isn't it?

Well, I can't say I expected to see you
wearing that...

Are you exploring what it's like to be a
thief, now?

Eheheh, I'm only kidding, of course.


Seeing that reminds me of when I still
worked in the royal palace.

That item was worn by the previous
chief, you know. It brings back such
memories...
*ahem* Anyway, that helm is a real
treasure to the Gerudo people and to
the chief.
I don't know how you got it, exactly, but
you must treat it with care."
4,Talk_01,"なんだい？
一応挨拶はしたが
アタシにはハイリア人の知り合いなんて
いた覚えはないがね…
アタシはずっと宮殿に仕えていたもんで
この街から一歩も外に出た事がないからねえ
ビューラが一人前になって
やっとゆっくりできると思った矢先
こんなことになっちまって…

しかし今アタシはもう引退した身
どうしてやることもできんがな…","What is it? I feel like I've met you before,
but I don't recall having any Hylian
acquaintances...
Especially since I've only ever served
in the palace. I've never even set foot
beyond the town's walls.
I thought I could relax at last, now that
Buliara has come of age. But then
something like this happens...
I'm retired now, though, so there isn't
anything I can do about it."
5,Talk_02,"あろうことか国の宝を盗られちまうなんて
警備兵は何をしてたんだか…
私が兵士長だった頃には
考えられん失態だよ… まったく情けない…
兵士長のビューラが前線に出ておれば
こんなことには ならんかっただろうに…","What were the guards doing while
thieves were sneaking into town and
making off with the chief's heirloom?
When I was captain of the guard, such a
failure would have been absolutely
unthinkable. It's just pathetic.
If Buliara was out on the front lines, this
would never have happened."
6,Talk_03,"でも まぁ…""誰もケガもせず
無事だったのは不幸中の幸いってもんだよ
まったく… 
こんな騒動二度とごめんだねぇ","I hope that I never have to witness
such turmoil ever again."
7,Talk_04,"アタシが現役ならば
兵士共全員鍛えなおしてやるんだけどねぇ","If I were still on active duty, I'd whip all
of those guards back into shape."
8,Talk_05,"少し前にな…

族長様の乗られたスナザラシが
魔物に驚いて暴走しちまって
ナボリスに近づいてしまったんだ…

ナボリスは近づく者を雷で退ける…

族長様もあわや雷の餌食に
なりかけちまってねぇ…
それ以来ビューラは
族長様のお側につきっきりなんだ","A little while ago...


The sand seal that the chief was
with got spooked by a monster and
ran off...
She quickly realized that it had pulled
her very close to Naboris...

Anyone who approaches Naboris risks
being struck by lightning from that
Divine Beast.
The chief was lucky to get away... And
ever since then, Buliara has refused to
leave her side."
9,Talk_06,"朝から晩まで
ペチャクチャと…
うるさくて ちっとも眠れないよ！

あんなにうるさいんじゃ
隣の家の住人も たまったもんじゃないだろうね","It's impossible to get a wink of sleep with
how noisy everyone is! All those young
ones at the canteen...
I'd like to whip their attitudes into
shape."

13,Talk_10,"少し前にな賊が宮殿に忍びこみ
この国の宝雷鳴の兜を盗んでいったんだ
賊に入られるだけでも情けないのに
あろうことか国の宝を盗られてしまうとは…
アタシが現役なら
兵士全員ゲルド砂漠100周の刑にして
一から鍛え直してやるんだがねぇ","A little while ago, a gang of thieves
slipped into the palace and stole the
chief's heirloom, the Thunder Helm.
It's bad enough to be robbed in general,
but for the object stolen to be a valued
heirloom belonging to our own chief...
If I was still in charge, any guard who
failed to catch those thieves would be
doing some serious manual labor.
And then they'd be thrown back into
training, all the way from the beginning.
No exceptions!"
14,Talk_11,"雷鳴の兜が戻ってきたらしいねぇ…

良かった良かった…

と言いたいところだが
なんでも取り返したのは
ゲルドの兵士ではなく
外から来た者だっていうじゃないか
まったく…兵士達は何をしてたんだか…

アタシが兵士長だった頃には
考えられん失態だよ… まったく情けない…
ビューラが前線に出ておれば
他人の手など借りずに済んだだろうに…","Apparently the Thunder Helm has been
returned to us. Thank goodness for
that...
But don't break out the glasses of Noble
Pursuit just yet. It wasn't even a Gerudo
soldier who did it...
It was some outsider, I hear. What were
the soldiers doing while this outsider was
demonstrating such skill?
When I was on active duty, this
avalanche of failures would be
unthinkable!
Buliara needs to get back out on the
front lines where she belongs."

things can't be easy.
With the Divine Beast raging around
and thieves breaking into town...

I'm retired now, though, so there isn't a
lot I can do, unfortunately..."
16,Talk_13,"神獣が鎮まったようだねぇ…

なんでもルージュ様がご活躍されたとか…

幼くともルージュ様は
立派な族長様だよ
今回の事でビューラも
ルージュ様を見る目が変わっただろうからねぇ
これからは今までのような
失態はなくなるはずだよ
やれやれ これでやっとアタシも
安心して休めるってもんだよ","It seems like the Divine Beast has finally
stopped stomping all over the desert...

I hear Lady Riju played an active part in
calming the creature, too.

She may be young and may seem out of
her depth, but she's certainly proven to
be a splendid chief.
With everything that's happened lately,
I'd bet Buliara is starting to see Lady Riju
differently, too.
I think the mishaps are behind us now.
Maybe now I can finally get some rest
and really relax."
