ウチの旦那もそうだけど
よその民族はヴォーイも小さくて

I wonder if you people eat enough..."

ここは眠らない街だからね…
いつでもお店はあいてるよ
お陰で旦那のもとへは
滅多に戻れないんだけどね…","Sav'saaba...
This is a city that doesn't sleep,
so this store is always open.
Unfortunately, being so busy means I
don't often make it home to my
husband..."
44,Talk_11,"サヴァーク

良い食事をとるには良い食材を選ばないとね
ウチのは旦那が作ってるから安心だよ","Sav'aaq. You know, the best meals are
made from the best ingredients...

That's what my husband says, anyway.
He's the one who does all the cooking,
so I take him at his word."
45,Talk_12,"…もしかして試食品狙い？
残念だけど ウチはそういうのやってないんだ
でも味は絶対保証するし
安心して買ってってよ","...Oh, were you hoping for some
samples?

Sorry, but we don't really do that...
I can guarantee that the flavor will be to
your liking, though!"
46,Talk_13,"私はこう見えて
もう結婚してるんだ！
新婚ってやつさ！

露天商してるヴァーイは
ほとんど みんな結婚してるんじゃないかな？
結婚したヴァーイはみんな外に住んでて
時々こうやってこの街に出稼ぎに来るんだよ
なかなか旦那には会えないけど
稼がないと生活できないしね
だから じゃんじゃん買うか売るかしてってよ","Oh, yes. And a newlywed, too! Many of
the vendors who work these stalls are
married, in fact.
It's pretty typical of married vai to live
outside these walls, really. But we come
back to sell our wares, of course!
It does mean I don't see my husband all
that often, but we have to make a living.

So buy and sell all you like!"
47,Talk_14,"サークサーク
ウチのは旦那が作ったヤツだから おいしいよ","Sarqso! I hope my husband stocked us
up with enough."
48,Talk_15,"サークサーク！

料理したいなら お向かいにある
共同キッチン使いなよ
火は自分で点けなきゃいけないけどね","Sarqso! If you want to do some cooking,
feel free to use that pot right over there.
You'll have to light the fire, though."
49,Talk_16,"サークサーク！
旦那にまた採ってきてもらわないとね","Sarqso! I gotta remember to tell my
husband to get some more!"
50,Talk_17,"いや～ あのナボリスが
大人しくなったそうじゃないか？
さすがは ウチの族長様だよ！

これでここも以前のように
観光客で にぎわうことだろうよ
…ああ でもそうなったら
今以上に旦那の元へ戻れなくなっちゃうか…
でも活気がないゲルドの街なんて
ゲルドの街じゃないからね
私も頑張んないとね！","Wowww! Naboris sure seems to have
finally calmed down, huh? I knew our
chief could do it!
I guess that means the tourists will come
back, and this place will be lively and
bustling again.
Aww... If that happens, I'll have even
fewer chances to slip away to visit
my husband...
Oh, what am I saying?! If Gerudo Town
isn't bustling, then it just isn't
Gerudo Town, you know?
I guess I'll have to do my part, too!"
51,Talk_18,サヴァーク,Sav'aaq!
52,Talk_19,サヴォッタ,Sav'otta!
53,Talk_20,サヴァサーバ,Sav'saaba!
54,Talk_21,"いや～ あのナボリスが
大人しくなったそうじゃないか？
さすがは ウチの族長様だよ！

これでここも以前のように
観光客で にぎわうことだろうよ
…ああ でもそうなったら
今以上に旦那の元へ戻れなくなっちゃうか…
いやでも たくさん売れたほうが
仕入れを理由に会いにいけるか…
でもまぁ とりえずは
アンタが買い占めた分を仕入れとかないとね","Wowww! Naboris sure seems to have
finally calmed down, huh? I knew our
chief could do it!
I guess that means the tourists will come
back, and this place will be lively and
bustling again.
Aww... If that happens, I'll have even
fewer chances to slip away to visit
my husband...
But... As long as I sell out of my stock,
I can go see him when I restock
the store!
Anyway, the first thing I need to do is
to restock everything that's been
bought!"
