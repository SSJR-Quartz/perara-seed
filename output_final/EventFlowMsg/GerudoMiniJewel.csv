11,Near,何とかしないと…,I have to do something...
12,Talk_01,なんて挨拶してる余裕なんてないのよ…,"Great! You got the last of my free time
with that greeting."
13,Talk_02,"サークサーク！

でも いいのかしら…見ず知らずのヴァーイに
こんなに親切にしてもらっちゃって…
お礼をしたいんだけど…
ずっと店も閉めてたから今手持ちがなくて…
そうだ！

火打ち石も手に入ったことだし
お礼にアクセサリーを どれか1つ如何かしら？","Sarqso!


But...I can't take this all from you with
just a sarqso. We hardly know each
other, and you've been so nice...
The shop's been closed so long,
I hardly have any inventory...

Oh, of course! Now that I have some
flint, I could make a jeweled accessory
for you if you're interested in something."
14,Talk_03,"あら… お気に召さなかったかしら？

でもお礼しないと私の気持ちがおさまらないし
1つ選んでもらえないかしら？","I'm sorry that these are all I have to offer
to show my appreciation...

But really...I need to give you something
to feel OK about accepting your help.
Could you please pick one?"
15,Talk_06,"アラ貴女…

何度も来てもらって悪いけど…

火打ち石がないことには
アクセサリーが作れなくて お店は開店休業なの
どこかに火打ち石10個譲ってくれる
親切なヴァーイがいれば別だけど…","Oh, you...


I'm sorry you keep coming here for
nothing...

Without flint, I can't process jewels, so
I can't sell anything in my shop.

It'd be a different story if a kind,
generous vai were to give me 10 pieces
of flint, though..."
16,Talk_08,"ウチはルビーやサファイアなんかを使って 
アクセサリーを作ってるの
宝石にはそれぞれ力が宿っててね
身に着けるとその加護を受けられるの","I use rubies, sapphires, and other gems
to make accessories. 

Each gem type has its own power that it
can transfer to whoever wears it."
17,Talk_09,"わざわざ来てもらったのに
ごめんなさいね","I'm sorry that you came all the way
to see me for nothing."
18,Talk_10,"貴女のために作った新作よ！
いいのができたんじゃないかしら！","Brand-new, especially for you!
I think it turned out really well!"
19,Talk_11,"貴女のおかげで
お店も再開できたし
アクセサリーが欲しいならいつでもいらっしゃい
貴女ならいつでも特別価格だから
他のお客さんにはナイショ…ね","Thanks to you, I got the shop running
again, so if you ever need an accessory,
please come by for a special discount.
Just...don't tell my other customers, OK?"
20,Talk_12,"ふふっ これを選ぶって思ってたわ
じゃあ ちょっと待ってて下さるかしら？","Teehee, I thought you might pick that
one. Please give me a moment..."
21,Talk_13,"ふふっ思った通り
私もこれが貴女に一番似合うかなって思ってたわ
でも今はポーチに空きがないみたいね…
荷物を整理してから また来てくれるかしら？","Teehee, I thought you might pick that
one. Just give—

Hang on. It doesn't seem like you've got
room for this right now. Perhaps you can
make some room and come back?"
22,Talk_14,"早く お礼をさせてもらいたいんだけど…

好きなアクセサリーは決まったかしら？","I'd like to give you something as thanks.


Have you decided on an accessory
you'd like?"
23,Talk_15,"でも火打ち石がないことには
何もできなくって…","There's nothing I can do about not
having any flint, though..."
24,Talk_16,"何度も来てもらって悪いけど…

火打ち石がないことには
アクセサリーも作れないし店は開店休業なの
はぁ… どこかに火打ち石10個譲ってくれる
親切なヴァーイとかいないかしら…","Sorry you keep coming here with nothing
to show for the trip...

Without flint, I can't make any
accessories, so the shop is closed
for now.
It would be a different story if a kind,
generous vai were to give me 10 pieces
of flint, though..."
25,Talk_17,えっ…,Uh...
26,Talk_18,"えっ？？

これ…譲ってくれるの？",What?! You're just...giving these to me?
27,Talk_19,"ルビーにはね寒さをしのげる耐寒効果があるの
ルビーの頭飾りがお好みかしら？","Rubies have the power to grant cold
resistance. So you'd like a ruby circlet?"
28,Talk_20,"サファイアには暑さをしのげる耐暑効果があるの
サファイアの頭飾りがお好みかしら？","Sapphires have the power to grant heat
resistance. So you think you'd like a
sapphire circlet?"

トパーズの耳飾りがお好みかしら？","Topaz has the power to grant electric
resistance. So you think you'd like
topaz earrings?"
30,Talk_23,"私は ハンドメイドでアクセサリーを作るお店を
経営してるんだけど
アクセサリーの加工に必要な
火打ち石を切らしちゃってて…
10個…そう10個あれば
何とかなるんだけど…
火打ち石10個譲ってくれる
親切なヴァーイが現れてくれたら
たんまり お礼を弾むんだけどね…

まぁ""世の中そんなにうまくは
行かないわよね","I manage a shop that specializes in
handmade accessories, but I've run out
of flint. I need it to make my items.
If only I had 10... Just 10... If some kind
vai would give me 10 pieces of flint, 
I could offer a nice reward...
I can dream all I want, though... Nothing
goes that smoothly in the real world."
31,Talk_24,"貴女 ハイリア人でしょ？
わざわざ来てもらったのに ごめんなさいね
ウチの店はしばらく休業よ","You're a Hylian, right? Listen, I'm sorry
you came all this way, but my shop is
gonna have to close for a bit."
32,Talk_25,"ん～
気持ちは嬉しいんだけどね…
火打ち石は10個そろってないと
意味がないの…","Hmm. Well, I do appreciate the gesture...


But unless I have 10 pieces of flint to
get started with, there's no point..."
33,Talk_26,"なんて挨拶してる余裕なんてないのよ…

神獣が大人しくなって
これから お客さんが増えるって時に
こんなことになるなんて…","I haven't really got the time to be
greeting people, honestly...

Now that the Divine Beast has finally
calmed down, there should be a rush of
customers any second...
So why did something like this have to
happen to me now, of all times?"
34,Talk_27,ほんとに…困ったもんだわ,"I'm in a bit of a jam, really..."
35,Talk_28,"はぁ…
どうしたもんかしら…","Hahh... Oooh, what to do, what to do..."
36,Talk_29,"ごめんなさいね…

何度来てもらっても
今は何にもできないのよ…","Vasaaq...


Not that I have any reason to be
greeting people..."
37,Talk_30,"ごめんなさい…

まだ火打ち石が手に入らなくて
何もできないのよ…
はぁ… どこかに火打ち石10個譲ってくれる
親切なヴァーイとかいないかしらね…","I'm sorry... I still haven't gotten my
hands on any flint. I can't really make
anything without it.
Hah... I wonder if a kind, generous
vai would give me 10 pieces of flint..."
38,Talk_31,"ごめんなさい…
まだ火打ち石が手に入らなくて
アクセサリー作りどころじゃないのよ…

はぁ… どこかに火打ち石10個譲ってくれる
親切なヴァーイとかいないかしらね…","I'm sorry... I haven't been able to get any
flint yet, so I'm not in a position to make
any accessories right now...
Hmm, I wonder if I'd be able to work if
a kind, generous vai were to give me 10
pieces of flint, though..."
