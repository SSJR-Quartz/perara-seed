ウワサ好きのミツバやで！
今回は歴史マニア垂涎のネタ！
大厄災で滅んだ兵士団のウワサを紹介するで！
『王族を守りし近衛兵！ 』

ハイラル城の兵士団には
王族を警護する近衛兵がおったんやけど
その装備が今もハイラル城に
残ってるらしいねん
元女中のお婆ちゃんの話やと食堂近くの通路と
訓練所と本丸の2階にある宝箱に入れてたらしい
いつかハイラル城が元通りになって
近衛兵たちが再結成される日が来るとええな
…ウチを守ってくれる近衛兵は
いつか現れてくれるんかな？
ミツバおススメ度 ★★★★★","From the moment I wake to the moment
I sleep, my mind is full of rumors. Even
my dreams are gossipy! Traysi here!
You fine folks keep up with dream
rumors too, don't you?

Well, this one's so good it might as well
be a dream. Listen up, history buffs!

This tidbit is about the brave soldiers
who were tragically wiped out during
the Great Calamity.
The royal guards who protected
the royal family!

Amongst Hyrule's soldiers, only the best
of the best had the honor of guarding
the royal family.
Apparently, the equipment they wore
can still be found somewhere in
Hyrule Castle.
They say a former maid spoke of treasure
near the Dining Hall, in the Guards'
Chamber, and on the second floor.
I do hope one day Hyrule Castle
is restored to its former glory,
complete with royal guards.
Hmm... I wonder when a royal guard
in shining armor will come sweep me
off MY feet...
Traysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★"
