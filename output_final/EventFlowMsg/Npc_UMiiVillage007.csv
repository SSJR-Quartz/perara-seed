お爺さんと話してたんですよ","Strange plants and guys with ugly faces
live just outside the village. There are
a lot of them, right?

I was chatting with my husband about
how there's a huge flower out there."

最近はマモノエキスが
滅多に手に入らなくてねぇ","Well, I was taught how to make
something called a monster cake too.

It's easy to make. You just need
Tabantha wheat, cane sugar, and
goat butter...
And you also have to add some
monster extract, but that's been
tough to come by lately..."
31,talk21,"私は料理も得意だけど
ケーキとかの お菓子の方が得意でね

お菓子屋をやっとりましたからね
だから若い頃 いろんなケーキの作り方を
教えてもらったりして","Sure, I can keep from burning water, but
my real gift is baking cakes and sweets
and the like.
My grandmother—wonderful woman—
ran a sweet shop for the royal family.
She taught me everything I know!"

何度でも教えて差し上げるわ
タバンタ小麦""きび砂糖""ヤギのバターに
マモノエキスを加えてごらん","Sure...sure...
I'll teach you as many times as you like.

to some Tabantha wheat, cane sugar,
and goat butter."
33,talk23,"マモノケーキは見た目は悪いし臭いもキツいけど
とっても精力が付くんだから","Monster cake may look a little gross

you right up!"
