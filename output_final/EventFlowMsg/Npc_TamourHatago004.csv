Recently I've been hearing about a
suspicious guy named Kilton...

He runs a shop called Fang and Bone.
They say he goes around pushing some
kind of cart night after night.
He's been making people around here
uncomfortable with his suspicious and
otherworldly activity..."

show his face around the stables."
