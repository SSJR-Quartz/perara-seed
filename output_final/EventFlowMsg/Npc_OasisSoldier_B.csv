1,Near_Raimei_001,そ それは雷鳴の…,That's the Thunder—
2,near00,…疲れた…,"So exhausted, ugh..."
3,talk00,"我らをたばかるとは
賊もいい度胸をしている
正々堂々の勝負なら
決して負けはしないものを…
しっかし… この鍛錬…
キツイな…","Those thieves sure have guts, scheming
against us like that. We'd never have lost
in a fair fight.
But this training... It's so tough..."
4,talk01,"ボブル先輩 まさか…

自分の頑張ってる姿がかっこいい！

とか

休まず鍛錬する事こそ正義！

とか思ってるんじゃないだろうな…
…まったく付き合わされる
こっちの身にもなってほしいよ","That Babi... \""Training without rest is the
pinnacle of discipline!\""

I wonder if that's what she's thinking...
I just can't keep up with her, though.
I wish she could feel how tired I am..."
5,talk02,"ボブル先輩…
ほっといたら延々と鍛錬してそうだな…
これ以上巻き込まれんように
目を合わさないでおこう…","Babi... If no one stopped her, I think she
would keep training for days and days
without taking a break.
I've gotta avoid eye contact... I don't
want to accidentally get dragged into
more training."
6,talk04,"向こうのチームで トラブルがあったようだが
どうせまたバレッタだろう…
アイツはほんとに トラブルメーカーだからな

とりあえず巻き込まれんように
目を合わせないでおこう…","Sounds like the team over there is having
trouble, but I'm sure it's just Barta again
anyway.
She's normally the source of their woes,
that's for sure.

I'm gonna avoid eye contact so
I don't get wrapped up in it..."
7,talk05,"おっ来た来た
兜を取り戻してくれたんだってな
いや～
正直助かったよ
じゃなければ あのままずっと
槍の訓練が続いていただろうからな","Oh, you're here! I heard you were able
to get the helm back for us, huh?

You really saved us by doing that, you
know?

If it was still in the hands of those
thieves, we'd all be stuck doing more
spear training..."
8,talk06,"賊も神獣も大人しくなったようだし
しばらく ゆっくりできると思ってたけど
ボブル先輩があんな調子じゃ
ゆっくりは させてくれないだろうなぁ
とりあえず先輩に絡まれんよう
目を合わないでいるんだ","Now that the thieves have been defeated
and the Divine Beast has calmed down,
I thought we'd definitely get a break...
But just looking at Babi, I can tell there
won't be any resting for a while yet.

Anyway, I'm gonna avoid eye contact and
try not to get sucked into things..."
9,talk07,"賊も懲りただろうし
しばらく ゆっくりできると思ってたけど
ボブル先輩があんな調子じゃ
ゆっくりは させてくれないだろうなぁ
とりあえず先輩に絡まれんよう
目を合わせないでいるんだ","Those thieves learned their lesson, so I
thought we'd be able to relax for a little
while...
But just looking at Babi, I can tell there
won't be any resting for some time.

I think I'll just avoid making eye contact
and try not to get singled out..."
