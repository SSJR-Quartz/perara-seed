1,Atacked00,"はぁ…ふぅ…ひぃ…
さすがに もうダメかと思ったよ…","Hoo... Phew! *gasp* I thought I was
done for!"
2,Atacked01,"これじゃあ
にっちもさっちもどうにも…",It looks like I'm stuck here...
3,Failed00,"ううう…あちこち痛い…
魔物のやつめ…","Ugh... My everything hurts... Monsters
are a real pain in my everywhere."
4,Failed01,"この歳で こんな目に遭うのはキツい
魔物め…歳の見境なく攻撃しやがって！","I'm too old for this nonsense. Blasted
monsters, and me rushing in without
a thought!"
5,Guardian00,"馬も人も命あっての物種だ！
ここは逃げるに限る！","This isn't worth risking my horsey's life...
or mine! I think I'd better run away now."
6,MSG_Futa_00,"俺に教えられるのは馬の事くらいだけど
それでいいな？
野生の馬を捕まえたら まずは馬宿だ
そこで登録すれば くらと手綱をつけてくれるぞ","I don't know much about much, but I
know a bunch about horsies. So if you
wanna hear about horsies, listen up.
Like, when you catch a wild horsey, you
should take it to a stable. Once you
register it, you'll get a saddle and bridle."

8,MSG_Futa_01,"…君は知ってるかどうか
人間を乗せてくれる動物は馬だけじゃないぞ
俺は馬以外には乗ろうとは思わんが
好奇心旺盛っぽい君は どうだろうな","We all know horsies are special...but
they're not the only animals that'll let
people ride them.
I wouldn't waste my time on anything
but a horse, but...you look like the type
of person who doesn't discriminate."
9,MSG_Futa_01_1,"背中に乗れる動物は馬だけじゃない
乗れそうな動物を見つけたら乗ってみな","Horsies aren't the only animals you can
ride. If you see an animal you think you
can ride, why not give it a shot?"
10,MSG_Futa_02,"君に ひとつ教えといてやろう
馬が好きな食べ物…それはニンジンだ
…誰もが知ってる情報で申し訳なかった
ちなみにニンジンはカカリコ村でも買えるぞ","Are you ready for some top-secret
horse-based intel? There's a food that
horses just love. It's...carrots.
Yeah, I suppose that does seem pretty
obvious in retrospect. By the way, you
can buy carrots in Kakariko Village."
11,MSG_Futa_02_1,"馬はニンジンが好きなんだ

カカリコ村でニンジンを買って
馬に与えてみるのも いいかも知れんな","Horses like carrots.


So maybe go buy some over in
Kakariko Village and try feeding
them to a horse."
12,MSG_Futa_03,"キッパリと言わせてもらう
俺が得意な話題は馬の事のみ！
馬上からも矢を射ることができるって
君は知ってたか？
魔物からの攻撃をかわしつつ
同時に攻撃したい時などに有効だろう","Here's the truth, straight from the
horse's mouth: the only thing I'm good
for is horses and horse facts.
Take this, for instance: did you know that
you can shoot arrows from horseback?

It's a good option if you want to pop a
few shots off without any monsters
getting any swings in at you."
13,MSG_Futa_03_1,"馬上からでも矢を射ることができるぞ
魔物の攻撃を走ってかわし矢で反撃するんだ","Try shooting your bow from horseback.
Run your horse around the monsters to
avoid their attacks while striking at them."
14,MSG_Futa_04,"…俺が話せるのは馬の事だけだ
それでかまわんな？
馬に乗り始めた頃は楽しさのあまり
村の中だろうが疾走したくなるが…
それは やめとけ
村人と馬にとって迷惑この上ない","I don't mind talking, as long as you don't
mind me talking about horses. That's
not a problem, is it?
Because riding horses is so much fun.
Don't you just want to ride at a full
gallop through every village you see?
You probably shouldn't do that, though.
It's a bother to both the villagers and
the horse."
15,MSG_Futa_04_1,"村の中で馬を飛ばすのは やめておけ
迷惑この上ないからな","Promise you won't ride your horse full
tilt through villages. Nothing worse than
being a nuisance to people."
16,Near00,愛馬とともに…,My best horsey at my side.
17,Near01,馬肥ゆる…,My horse's belly is full...
18,Near02,くらの手入れを…,Need to buff my saddle...
19,Near03,馬と見る星…,Stargazin' with horsey...
20,Near04,馬濡らしの雨…,Rain's got horsey damp...
21,Rest_00,"馬が好きでねぇ

女性の好みも どうしても面長のタイプを
選びがちなんだよ","I love horsies.


Love 'em more than people. People
smell funny and talk all the time,
but not horsies. Horsies just ride."
22,Rest_01,"雨の日は無理して出かけないよ
馬も俺も濡れるのは好きじゃないんでね","I don't care much to go out on rainy
days. Me and my horsey don't like
getting wet."
23,Rest_02,"俺の馬はナイーブでね…
雨の日は少しばかり機嫌が悪いんだ","My horsey's feeling blue... He gets a
little sensitive on rainy days."
24,RetMSG_Futa_00,"…俺の話題は馬だけだぞ？
それでいいなら こんなのはどうだ…
馬にも いろいろなタイプがいる
足の速い馬…馬力のある馬…
自分に合った馬を探す事が
馬と上手に付き合うコツってことかな","I'm warning you, I only talk horse talk.
Not, like, talking the way horses talk.
I mean talking about horses.
There are several types of horses, for
instance. Fast ones. Powerful ones. Get
to know what your horse is good at."
25,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,"馬にも いろいろなタイプがいる
自分に合った馬を探してみる事だな","There are all kinds of horses, so get to
know yours, and find one that's suited
to what you need."
26,RetMSG_Futa_01,"♪白馬に巨大馬骨の馬～
ホントにいるなら乗ってみたい～
…何の歌かって？
俺が作った伝説の馬たちの歌だよ","♪White horsies, giants, and bony ones
too. They're out there for catchin', and
that's what you should do...♪
You like my song about the legendary
horses? There's only one of each, but I
took some liberties to make it musical..."
27,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,"♪白馬に巨大馬骨の馬～
ホントにいるなら乗ってみたい～
俺の作った歌は どうだ？
その名も「伝説の馬たち」！覚えてくれよな","♪White horsies, giants, and bony ones
too. They're out there for catchin', and
that's what you should do...♪
That's my slightly inaccurate but highly
lyrical song about the legendary horses.
It'll get stuck in your ear real good!"
28,RetMSG_Futa_02,"…何か情報がほしいのか？
だったらそうだな馬について教えてやろう
馬だって走れば疲れる
拍車をかければいいってもんじゃない
今どんな状態なのか目で確認することだ","So you want some information, do you?
Well, if you don't mind it bein' about
horses, I'm your man!
Horses get awful tired of runnin'. You
can't just dig in your spurs all the time.
Use your eyes to see how they're doing."
29,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"馬だって走れば疲れる
馬がどんな状態なのか目で確認することだ","Horses can get tired after galloping for
a long time. Take a moment to check in
and see how your horsey's doing!"
30,RetMSG_Futa_03,"…名所案内でもしてほしいのか？
俺の場合 どうしたって馬がらみになるぞ？
じつは ここから東の方角に
馬術訓練場の跡地がある
地図にも載るほどの重要な施設だったが
今じゃ魔物が何やら訓練してるみたいだな","You want me to point out some local
areas of interest? Sorry, but I only talk
about horses. All day, every day.
Although...if you head east from here,
you'll find the ruins of the old horse
training ground.
It's pretty important. Shows up on maps
and everything. Sounds like it's got a bit
of a monster infestation goin' on now..."
31,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"東には馬術訓練場の跡地がある
今じゃ魔物の訓練所と化してるがな","If you head east from here, you'll find
the ruins of the old horse training
ground.
Sounds like it's got a bit of a monster
infestation goin' on now, though..."
32,RetMSG_Futa_04,"…君が何を知りたいのかは無視して
馬の捕まえ方のコツを教えてやろう
気付かれぬよう後ろからそっと近づいて
素早く乗ったら撫でまくるんだよ","You probably don't care for horsey facts,
but that's all I've got to offer, so hold
on to your...well, you know.
The secret to holding on to your horses,
by the way, is to approach them quietly
from behind and then hop on quick!
Once you're on, give 'em a little pet to
let them know you care."
33,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"馬を捕まえるなら気付かれぬよう
後ろから近づいて乗れたら撫でまくるんだ！","The secret to catching horses is to
approach them quietly from behind
and then hop on quick!
Once you're on, give 'em a little pet to
let them know you care."
34,SavedLv1_00,何とか助かった！,"I'm saved! Somehow, I've been saved!"
35,SavedLv1_01,"命あっての旅だからな！
助けてくれて ありがとう！","They say the journey is more important
than the destination...but not if I get
killed along the way... Thank you."
36,SavedLv2_00,"馬のおかげで逃げ切れた…
もちろん君にも感謝だよ","Thanks to my faithful horsey, I was able
to ride to safety! I mean, I guess you
helped too. So...thank you?"
37,SavedLv2_01,"馬も俺も助かった！
君には尻尾を向けられないな","You've saved me and my horse and/or
horses! I won't forget what you did."
38,SavedLv3_00,"…ありがとうな
おかげで命がつながった","Thank you. I thought today might be my
last, but thanks to you, it won't be."
39,SavedLv3_01,魔物の恐ろしさを あらためて知ったよ…,"When you're a kid, you hear tales about
how scary monsters are, but when you're
an adult, you get to find out firsthand..."
40,Thanks00,わずかばかりだが感謝の気持ちだ…,"I know it's not much, but I'd like to
give you some kind of thanks."
