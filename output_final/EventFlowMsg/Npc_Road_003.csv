1,Atacked00,"はぁ… はぁ…
危なかったねぇお互い…","Whew... Hoo, boy... That was
pretty dangerous for both of
us. But mostly for you."
2,Atacked01,魔物は まだいるみたいだなぁ…,"I don't like the look of this... There are
still some monsters running around..."
3,Failed00,アイタタ…古傷も一緒に痛みだした…,"Ow ow ow... My bum knee's started
acting up on me now, too!"
4,Failed01,心配だなぁ…また襲われるんじゃないか？,"I'm feeling really stressed out... What if
we get attacked again?"
5,Guardian00,"とっとと逃げよう…
ガーディアンが おいらたちを探してるはず","We've got to get out of here!
There's a Guardian after us!"
6,MSG_Rane_00,"心配だなぁ ゾーラ川の上流…
雨がずっと降り続いてるらしいからなぁ
ゾーラ族のみなさん
洗濯物を干せないよなぁ
あれ？ゾーラ族って服着てなかったかな？
いや普通に着てたっけ？
心配だなぁ おいらの記憶力…","I've been really worried about Zora River
lately... It's been raining nonstop, from
what I hear...
Those poor Zora can't hang their
laundry out to dry. Not in weather
like that!
Wait. Do Zora even wear clothes?
Maybe? I can never remember...
Should I be worried about my memory?"
7,MSG_Rane_00_1,"ゾーラ川の上流は
ずっと雨が降ってるんだってなぁ
あれじゃ洗濯物を干せないよなぁ…","It's been raining for ages upstream
on Zora River. I'm worried that nobody's
laundry will dry..."
8,MSG_Rane_01,"ゾーラ族には もう会ったかな？

この湿地帯に住んでる種族なんだけど
君と馬が合うかどうか心配だなぁ
馬というか魚な感じなんだけどね","Have you ever met any Zora?


They're an aquatic race that lives in this
watery region. I'm a little worried about
how they'll take to you, though...
Seeing as how you don't have fins."
9,MSG_Rane_01_1,"君は もうゾーラ族には会ったかな？
なんと言うか…魚っぽい感じのヤツらだよ","Have you ever met any Zora? They're
the, uh, how should I put this...
The fishy ones."
10,MSG_Rane_02,"ちゃんと行けるか心配だなぁ…

いやねじつはこれから君に
カカリコ村への行き方を教えるんだけどね
いいかい覚えてくれよ
この丘を南東に登ればいいんだ
とはいえ…ちゃんと行けるか心配だなぁ","I'm not sure I should tell you this...
I'm worried about what you'd do with
the knowledge...
Oh, well. I guess I'll tell you anyway!
Here's how you get to Kakariko Village.

So pay attention. At the fork in the road
here, head east.

Of course, now that I've told you how to
get there... I'm worried you'll never
make it."
11,MSG_Rane_02_1,"カカリコ村は この丘の上だよ
君がちゃんと行けるか心配だなぁ","If you're trying to get to Kakariko Village,
head east at the fork here. But I'm a little
worried about you making it all the way."
12,MSG_Rane_03,"心配だなぁカカリコ村の農家…

村で一番の特産品が ニンジンかカボチャかで
ちょっとした争いが起きてるらしくてね","I'm worried about the farmers in
Kakariko Village...

They grow pumpkins and carrots. It's
sort of their specialty. But I hear there's
a little war going on between them..."
13,MSG_Rane_03_1,"カカリコ村は特産品がニンジンかカボチャかで
争ってるんだって心配だなぁ…","Farmers in Kakariko Village are fighting
over whether carrots or pumpkins should
be their official vegetable.
I worry about them..."
14,MSG_Rane_04,"心配だなぁカカリコ村の長…

かなり長く生きてらっしゃるらしいから
誕生日のローソクがケーキを覆いつくしそうで…","I've been worried about the elder of
Kakariko Village lately...

She's lived a really long life...so her
birthday cake must be just covered in
candles... What if it just tastes like wax..."
15,MSG_Rane_04_1,"カカリコ村の長 かなり長生きだから
誕生日のローソクが ケーキを覆いつくしそう…","The elder of Kakariko Village has lived a
very long life. I bet her birthday cake
is just covered in candles..."

18,Near02,まあまあの一日…,Not a bad day...
19,Near03,いろいろ心配だなぁ…,So much to worry about...
20,Near04,濡れちゃうなぁ…,Aw. Now I'm all wet...
21,Rest_00,"おいら旅人だけど君のような冒険家じゃない
ハイラル平原みたいな危険地帯は御免だよ
多少遠くてもカカリコ村か湿原の馬宿ら辺を
散策するのが好きなんだな","I'm no adventurer, not like you. I'd
rather keep away from dangerous
places like Hyrule Field.
Even if it's a bit of a trek, I prefer safer
hikes, like around Kakariko Village or
the Wetland Stable."
22,Rest_01,"心配だなぁ雨の日の君が…

崖を登ろうとしても雨で滑って登れなくて
イライラする君の姿が目に浮かぶよ","I'm worried about you in this rain...


I mean, imagine how irritated you'd be
if you tried to climb a cliff in the rain, but
you kept slipping and couldn't..."
23,Rest_02,"心配だなぁ…
この雨 やまなかったりして…
やまなかったら ずっとここで雨宿り
ああ心配だなぁ…","They say there's no such thing as an
endless rain, but I'm worried that,
whoever they are, they might be wrong."
24,RetMSG_Rane_00,"心配だなぁ…
おいらが止めても君は北西に向かうんだろ？
ハイラル城の辺りは特に危ないから
どうしても行くのなら装備を整えておきなよ","I'm worried about you... You're going
to head northwest, even if I warn you
not to, aren't you?
It's especially dangerous around
Hyrule Castle, so if you insist on
going, make sure you're well equipped."
25,RetMSG_Rane_00_1,"北西にあるハイラル城の周辺は特に危ないから
どうしても行くのなら装備を整えておきなよ","The area around Hyrule Castle, up
northwest from here, is dangerous, but if
you must go, have your gear ready first."
26,RetMSG_Rane_01,"心配だなぁ おいらの身が…
我ながらハイラル城のこと知りすぎててさ…
隠し通路があって西坑道から侵入できるとか
中には お宝が眠っているとかさぁ","I'm worried about my safety. You see...
I know too much. About Hyrule Castle,
specifically.
See, there's this secret West Passage
you use to sneak in. I've heard there's
treasure inside, too."
27,RetMSG_Rane_01_1,"ハイラル城には西坑道から入れる通路があって
中には お宝が眠っているとか…","There's a way into Hyrule Castle through
the West Passage is what I've heard. And
they say there's treasure inside, too."
28,RetMSG_Rane_02,"心配だなぁ…
おいらが止めても城に宝探しに行くんだろ？
強い武器なんかも隠されてるって話だけど
そこにたどり着く前に…ああ心配だなぁ","I'm worried about you... You're planning
to go treasure hunting inside the castle
even if I try to stop you, aren't you?
Sure, there are bound to be plenty of
strong weapons inside, but before you
even reach them... Oh, I'm so worried."
29,RetMSG_Rane_02_1,"おいらが止めても城に宝探しに行くんだろ？
強い武器が隠されてる って話だけど…","You'd head for the castle to look for
treasure even if I tried to stop you... The
lure of powerful weapons is too strong."
30,RetMSG_Rane_03,"心配だなぁ ニンジン料理…

2種類あるニンジンを組み合わせると
その料理は確実に失敗するらしいんだよ
君が面白がって試しそうで…心配だなぁ","I'm worried about carrots...


Did you know that if you accidentally
mix two different types of carrot, your
dish will be a disaster?
Oh, no... I can see by that look in your
eye... You won't listen to me... You're
going to mix them anyway, aren't you?"
31,RetMSG_Rane_03_1,"2種類のニンジンを組み合わせた料理は
確実に失敗するらしいんだよ…","Don't take my word for it, but any dish
you make by mixing two types of carrot
will definitely be a disaster."
32,RetMSG_Rane_04,"心配だなぁ塩分摂りすぎ…

どんな料理にも合う岩塩は
カカリコ村で簡単に手に入るっていうしなぁ","I'm worried about my salt intake...


After all, it's pretty easy to get your
hands on rock salt in Kakariko Village.
And it tastes good with everything..."

rock salt in Kakariko Village. And it
tastes good with everything..."
34,SavedLv1_00,もう魔物はいない？ どう？,Are all the monsters all gone? Well?
35,SavedLv1_01,生きた心地がしなかったなぁ…,I was certain I wasn't going to make it...
36,SavedLv2_00,なんとか命拾いしたって感じだなぁ…,I feel like I just had a brush with death!
37,SavedLv2_01,"おいらは別に
冒険家ってわけじゃないんだけどなぁ","I'm not cut out for adventure or anything
like that. Adventure makes me break out
in a cold sweat."
38,SavedLv3_00,この辺りも魔物が増えたなぁ…,"There've been a lot of monsters
wandering around here lately."
39,SavedLv3_01,今のうちに この場を去った方がいいね…,"I wonder if we should get out of here
now while we have a chance..."
40,Thanks00,"助けてくれてありがとう
これ受け取って","Thanks for saving me. I'm worried that
I might not be grateful enough, so take
this..."
