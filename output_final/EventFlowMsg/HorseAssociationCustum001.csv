どうぞ ここに愛馬を連れてきてくださいな","Hello there, traveler. Welcome to
our stable. You will stay awhile,
won't you?
If you have a horse, we can help you
change its gear or mane style.

We're always happy to meet new horses,
so stop on by!"
11,Talk00_01,"ふぅ馬たちといっしょにいると時間がたつのも
忘れてしまうわね…","Ahhh... Just being around horses
makes you forget all about the
passing of time, doesn't it?"
12,Talk01,"旅のかたね ようこそ馬宿へ！

あら…？","Hello there, traveler. Welcome to
our stable. You will stay awhile,

Oh?"

mane on this little one again, correct?"
16,Talk01_1,"あら？全然 なついてないわね…

もしかして捕まえてきたばかりかしら？
もっと愛情をそそいであげてね","Oh? Your horse doesn't seem to
be tamed. At all.

Did you just catch it, by any chance?
Please spend some time showing this
sweetie you care, and then come back."
17,Talk01_2,"うーん？ この子 まだ あなたを
信頼してないみたい…
もっと愛情をそそいであげたら
きっと なついてくれるわよ","Hm? This little one doesn't seem to trust
you just yet...

Spend some time showing this little love
how much you care, and you'll tame it in
no time."
18,Talk01_3,"へぇ この子 かなりいい目してるわね
でも まだ完全に信頼してるわけじゃないわ
もっと愛情をそそいであげて！
そしたら この子喜んで馬の装備をつけてくれる","Nice! This little one has calm eyes,
but it doesn't fully trust you yet.

You need to show it some more love!
Do that and I'll be happy to help you
out with some gear."
19,Talk01_4,"わぁ！ すごい キラキラした目！

この子 あなたに首ったけって感じね
いいわ この子なら馬の装備変更してあげる！","Wow! This one's eyes are positively
sparkling with affection!

I can tell this little one is just head over
heels for you. That settles it! I'll gladly
help you out with some gear!"
20,Talk02,"だけど私…愛情いっぱいに育てられた馬しか
興味がないのよねぇ…
あなたの馬はどうかしら?","Oh, but you should know I'm only
interested in horses that are raised
with lots of love!
How's your horse faring on that front?"
21,Talk04,"そう残念ね…馬の装備を変更したくなったら
また きてちょうだいね","Aw, that's too bad... Please come back

ごめんなさいね","Hello there! That's a mighty fine horse
you have.

If you like, I can change out its gear
or maybe...

Oh? My goodness, that's no pony, is it?
It's so big!

I'm sorry, but I don't think I have any
gear that'd fit such a large horse, and I
bet it wouldn't like its mane handled...
I'm so sorry about that."
23,Talk08,どお？ お気に召したかしら？,So what do you think?
24,Talk09,フムフム…,Hmm...

you get one."

If you like, I can change out her gear
or maybe...

Oh? Actually, this horse is different
from any I've ever seen before.
My, she's so lovely and graceful...
I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure this little
lady would absolutely hate it if you
changed her mane or gear.
I'm so sorry about that."
38,Talk26,は今のタテガミよ？,"Isn't  the mane
your horse companion already has?"

the saddle your horse companion 
already has."
