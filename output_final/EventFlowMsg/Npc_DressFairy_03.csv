四姉妹の長姉 テーラ
アナタの ご活躍…
ツボミの中から ずっと拝見しておりました
それはそれは東奔西走
丁々発止の大活躍でございましたわ

証拠に今アナタが何を思っているか
見通して差し上げましょう
…

……","I am the great earth fairy, Tera. I am the
oldest of the four sisters.

I have been watching your activities from
inside my bud all this time!

And haven't you been busy, swinging
that sword around, adventuring...

I'm not just making wild assumptions,
you know! I truly do see all...

I'll prove it right now! I'll...predict what
you are thinking right at this moment!

9,Revival00_2,"アナタ…

「前置きはいいから早く服を強くしてくれ」
って思ってますわね？","You're probably thinking...\""Can't we just
skip to the part where she enhances my
clothing...\"" Right?"
10,Revival00_3,"アナタ…「服がもっと強ければなぁ」
って お思いですわね？","You're probably thinking...\""I wish my
clothes were stronger...\"" Right?"
11,Revival00_4,"どうやら図星でございますわね？
アハン…せっかちな お方…
ええそれでは強くされたい服を
お見せになってあそばせ？
アナタがお持ちの材料次第で
アタクシが服を強くして差し上げますわ！","Looks like I hit the mark, hm? *ahem...* 
What an impatient person...

Why don't you show me the clothing you
want to have enhanced?

Depending on what materials you have
on hand, I should be able to enhance
your clothing. But it all depends!"
12,Talk00,…服を強くしに いらしたんでしょ？,"...You came to me to have your clothing
enhanced, right?"
13,Talk01,"アハン…""残念でございます","Awww... Well, that's just a shame."
14,Talk02,"アタクシの妹で力を取り戻していないのが
まだ居るようでございます
この先大きなツボミを見つけたら
力を貸してあげてくださいね","My sisters in other parts of the world still
need you to restore their power.

If you see a giant flower bud as you
journey through Hyrule, please stop
and help."
15,Talk04,"かしこまりました
じゃ目をつぶって…","Understood! Now, close your eyes..."
16,Talk05,"妹達の力も取り戻してくださったんですね

アタクシ達の力が必要でしたら
いつでも お越しくださいね","It seems you've restored my sisters'
powers as well.

If you ever have need of our power, just
stop on by."
17,Talk06,他のは どうなさいますの？,What about the others?
18,Talk07,い…息継ぎ失敗したわ…,Guess... Guess that's it for my break...
19,Talk08,どの服を強くなさいますの？,"Which clothing item would you like me to
enhance?"
20,Talk09,それでは アタクシ帰りますわね,"Well then, I'm headed home!"
21,Talk10,お…おぼれるところだった…,I set a new deep-dive record!
22,Talk11,み…水飲んだ…,Water... I inhaled a lot of water...
23,Talk12,ハァハァ…水の中では寝ないほうがいいわね…,"Hahh... Sleeping underwater is not
a good idea, as it turns out..."
24,Talk13,"今のアタクシなら アナタの服
少しだけ""強くして差し上げられますわよ？","With the power available to me...
I should be able to enhance your
clothing a little bit!"

38,Talk27,"それではを
強くされるという事で…","OK! I'll enhance the
, then?"
39,Talk28,"承りました
で ございますわね？","Got it! You want me to enhance the
, then?"
40,Talk29,"その服を強くするのは無理でございますわ
アタクシにも色々事情がございまして…","Oh? It looks like it is impossible for me
to enhance that clothing item..."
41,Talk30,"ごめんあそばせ アタクシの力でも
強くできない服が ございますの","I'm sorrrrry! There are some clothing
items that I cannot enhance, even at
my power level."
42,Talk31,"あら～～ん…
その服を強くするのは無理でございますわ","Hmmm... It seems it is impossible for me
to enhance that clothing item..."
43,Talk32,"その服は無理ですわ
アタクシにも限界は ありますのよ…","That clothing item... It's just not
possible... Even I have my limits."
44,Talk33,"その服を強くするのは今は無理…
妹達が目覚めてたら話は別ですけど","I can't enhance that item now! If my
sisters were awakened as well,
that would be a different story, though..."
45,Talk34,"アタクシの力だけでは強くするの無理ですわ
妹達の力も借りないと…","I cannot enhance that with my power
alone, you know? I would need the help
of my sisters, as well."
46,Talk35,"その服を強くするのは無理ですわ
アタクシ一人の力だけでは…ね","Ahh. There's no way I can enhance
that clothing item! Not with my
power alone."
47,Talk36,"その服を強くされたいのですね？
それなら妹達の力も取り戻して差し上げて…","If you want me to enhance that
clothing item, you will need to aid my
sisters in getting their power back."
48,Talk37,"材料が足りてないようですわ
またいらしてくださる？","You don't have the materials I need to
work my magic! Once you have them all,
come back to see me!"
49,Talk38,"あ～ら？材料が足りませんわ？
さすがに泉の水だけでは作れません事よ？","Oh... You don't have the materials
I need. There isn't a lot I can do if you
don't have the materials..."
50,Talk39,"その服強くされたいなら
材料を そろえていらして？","If you want me to enhance that clothing
item, you're going to have to bring
me the materials..."
51,Talk40,"その服なら材料が足りてないので
強くできませんことよ？","You don't have the materials needed to
enhance that clothing item, so I can't do
it. What a bother."
52,Talk41,"ゴホッゴホッ…
",*cough...cough*
53,Talk42,ゲホッ…ゲホッ…,*cough...cough*
54,Talk43,ゲ…ゲフッ…,*cough...*
55,Talk45,あ～ら？遠慮は要りませんことよ？,"Oh? No need to be shy, you know?"
56,Talk46,じゃ他のにされます？,"Well, want to try another one?"
57,Talk47,それでしたら他のを強くされちゃいます？,Then...shall we try a different one?
58,Talk48,分かりましたじゃ選び直してくださいな,Got it. Then pick another one.
59,Talk49,"でっきた～ん！""我ながら完璧","All dooone! And it's perfect, if I do say
so myself."
60,Talk50,できた！ なかなかの会心作ですわよ！,"All done! Perfect... Sometimes I'm so
good it's scary."
61,Talk51,はァ～い一丁上がりでございます！,Another one down!
62,Talk52,"できましたわ！
ばっちり強くなってございますわよ！","All done! Yep, looks enhanced to me."
63,Talk53,"でもでもォ？ アタクシが強くできそうな服
お持ちじゃない と？
アタクシの早とちりかも知れませんから
一応確認させていただいても よろしくて？","What's this? You don't have any clothes
that I can enhance? None at all?

How about we take a look, just to be
sure. Let me see what you've got."
64,Talk54,"他の服も強くしたかったのですが
もう無理みたい…","I wanted to make some of your other
clothes stronger, but that just doesn't
seem possible."
65,Talk55,"どうして強くできないのか
アタクシが見て差し上げますわ","Let's see... What's stopping me from
enhancing these things, I wonder..."
66,Talk56,"…あら？裸なのはいいとしても
服を一つも お持ちじゃないみたい
強くできそうな服を手に入れたら
また お越しくださいね","Ah. Ignoring the fact that you're going to
get an awful sunburn walking around like
that during the day...
Do you really not have any clothing?
When you get some clothing that I can
enhance, come visit and I'll do my thing!"
67,Talk57,"足りないのは服か素材か…
もしかしたら妹達の力も必要かと","You are lacking either the clothes or the
materials... Or maybe I need my sisters'
powers? It's all possible..."
68,Talk58,"服と素材をそろえたら
是非 お越しになってくださいませ","When you're carrying the clothes and
materials with you, please come back
and visit me here!"
69,Talk59,"さぁ…できましたわよ！
我ながら いい仕上がり…
強くした服で全身をそろえられると
新たな力が生まれることが ありますわよ","Here...it's finished!
Hmmm...

You know, some sets—if you enhance
each part of the set twice—will give you
a special set bonus.
Not every set, mind you! But some sets..."
