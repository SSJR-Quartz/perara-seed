9,talk00,"やぁ おはよう…
ゲルド語でいうなら 「サヴォッタ」かな…","Good morning... Though it's \""sav'otta\"" in
Gerudo, isn't it?"
10,talk01,やぁ こんにちは…,Hello there...
11,talk02,"こんばんは…
ゲルド語でいうと 「サヴァサーバ」かな…","Good evening... Though I guess it's
\""sav'saaba\"" in Gerudo, isn't it?"
12,talk03,僕はリトの村からやって来たんだ…,I came here from Rito Village...
13,talk04,そうリトの村…,"Yes, Rito Village..."
14,talk05,おお…リトは寒かったろう…？,"Ah... It must have felt quite cold to you,
didn't it?"
15,talk06,"そのリトの村から
出稼ぎに来たのは いいんだけど…
ここの昼間は凄い暑さでね…
これ以上先に進むことができなくてさ…
中に入れずとも
ゲルドの街辺りまでは行ってみたいんだけどね…","I had a great plan, you know. I left
Rito Village to try to earn some money
out in the world...
But it's so incredibly hot here during the
day. It's been tough to work up the will
to go any farther.
I would like to see what Gerudo Town
looks like, even if I can't go inside...
It's just so hot..."
16,talk07,"その前に…
初めまして…かな？","But before I say any more...
Have we...met before?"
17,talk09,"ひんやり効果のある虫と魔物の素材から作る
暑さをしのげる薬があるって聞いたんだけど…
どこにも売ってないんだ…

作ろうかとも思ったけど
ひんやり効果のある虫はこの辺じゃ
ゲルド高地の寒い所まで行かないといないし
あの辺は魔物も多いしね…
どうしたもんかなぁ… と思って
ここでずっと考えてるんだ","I heard there's an elixir that can help 
beat the heat. It's made from insects 
with cooling effects and monster parts.
But they don't seem to be selling the
elixir anywhere...

I've heard insects with these cooling 
effects live in the cold parts of the
Gerudo Highlands, but...
Well, the monsters there are rough, to
say the least, so I'm not having a lot of
success getting myself motivated..."
18,talk10,"ん…
おお…
眠ってしまっていたようだな…","Hm?
Oof...

Looks like I fell asleep..."
19,talk12,"昼間の砂漠がこんなに暑いなんて
知らなかったよ…
やっぱり何事も経験しないといけないね…","I never knew the desert in the middle of
the day could get so darned hot.

I guess you can't really understand
something until you've experienced it
for yourself, huh..."
20,talk14,"ここからかなり北…
タバンタ辺境の小さな村さ…","Far to the north of here...
It's a modest village on the
Tabantha Frontier..."
21,talk15,"いつかは可愛い我が子にも
旅をさせてやらないとな…","I'm going to have to get my young one
to get out and travel too...someday..."
22,talk19,"薬も手に入れたし
もちろん すぐにでも出かけたいところだけど…
夜の砂漠は危険だからね…
明るくなってからにするよ…","With the elixir, I can go as soon as I
want, but... Well, the desert isn't all that
safe at night.
I think I'll wait till it's light out."
23,talk20,"薬も手に入れたし
もちろんすぐにでも出かけたいところだけど…
急ぐことはないし…
明日からにするよ…","With the elixir, I can go as soon as I
want, but...there's no rush, really.
I think I'll leave tomorrow."
