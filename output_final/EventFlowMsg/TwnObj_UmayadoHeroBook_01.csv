8,Book01,"今日ゾーラの里に
ハイラル王の表敬団が訪れた
その中に ハイリア人で4歳くらいの
男の子がいた…名前はリンク
第一印象は元気で笑顔が可愛い
ごく普通の子供かな
でも話を聞くと リンクは剣がすごく上手で
大人たちを次々に負かしてしまうんだって
ただ暴れん坊なのか全身アザだらけ
だから治療をしてあげた
治癒の力を見るのは初めてだったみたい
目を丸くして見上げてくる彼の顔が可愛かった","At the request of Hyrule's king,
a group of outsiders came to
greet us at the domain.
One of them was a Hylian child of
only about four years of age.
His name was Link.
He made quite a first impression. He was
curious and full of energy, with a ready
smile. Are all Hylian children that way?
One thing that surely sets him apart is
his swordsmanship, which I hear is
exceptional. He has even bested adults.
He must be somewhat reckless, however,
as he was covered in bruises. Wishing to
be helpful, I healed his wounds for him.
It must have been his first time seeing
healing magic, as he looked up at me
with big, round eyes. It was...adorable."
9,Book02,"ゾーラの里で神獣が発掘された…
名前は ヴァ・ルッタ
発掘現場で初めて見たルッタは すごく可愛い
丸くて大きくて お鼻が長くて…
発掘に来ていたシーカー族の話だと
神獣は人が操るものらしい
昔 こんな大きなものを人が動かしていた…
今度も誰かが操ることになるのかな？","A Divine Beast was excavated from
Zora's Domain. This one is called
Vah Ruta.
The first time I laid eyes on Ruta, I was
surprised by how cute it was. It's so big
and round, with a long, awkward nose.
According to the Sheikah who found
Ruta, Divine Beasts require someone
worthy to control them.
It's fun to imagine someone piloting this
enormous beast in the distant past.
I wonder who will have that honor next."
10,Book03,"久し振りにリンクが里に来た… でも子供の頃と
ずいぶん雰囲気が変わったみたい
近衛騎士になり退魔の剣を携えた彼は
口数が減り あの笑顔も無くしてしまってた
「何かあったの？」って訊いても
リンクは何も言わず ただ首を振るだけ
…背が私より高くなったせいかな？
リンクは私の頭越しに遠くを見てる気がする…","Link came to visit the domain. It feels like
forever since he was here last. He no
longer resembles the child I first met.
He is now an accomplished knight and
keeper of the sword that seals the
darkness. I am so proud. However...
He hardly speaks anymore, and smiles
even more rarely. He is still the kind
soul I knew, but something has changed.
I asked him if something had happened,
if something was wrong. He merely
shook his head.
Perhaps it is his newly acquired height,
but I feel he is ever looking past me,
into the distance beyond..."
11,Book04,"里を訪れた ハイラル王国の御姫様が
「貴女を神獣の繰り手に」と言ってくれた
厄災に立向かうために貴女の力が必要って…
それを聞いたとき心が決まった
厄災ガノンが復活したら この里だって皆だって
どんな事になるか分からない
私に出来る事なら やりたい
皆を…護りたい
それに神獣は ガノンと戦う騎士を…
リンクを助ける為の存在だそうだから…","The princess of Hyrule paid a special
visit to the domain. She asked me if I
would agree to pilot a Divine Beast.
She told me she needs my help to face
the Calamity. My heart knew at once
what to do. I agreed without reservation.
Calamity Ganon must not be resurrected.
If he is, there is no way to ensure the
safety of my people, or of anyone.
I do not know what will happen. All I
know is that if there is anything I can do
to help, I must try. I must protect Hyrule.
There is also that...the Divine Beasts are
meant to assist the chosen hero when he
faces Ganon. In this way, I can help Link."
12,Book05,"今日久し振りに リンクが里に来てくれたので
雷獣山のライネルに皆が困ってる話をした
リンクが黙って山に歩き出したので
思わず後を追って行った
彼は一人だけで行こうとしたけど
それでも引かずに リンクについて行った…
山腹まで登ったとき不意を突いて現れた
ライネルに背後から襲いかかられてしまった
もうダメ… と思ったとき
リンクが素早く退魔の剣を鞘から抜き放った
…ライネルを圧倒する リンクの剣技は
速く力強く そして流麗だった
目の前で起こってるのは戦いの筈なのに
リンクの あまりにも美しい動きに魅了された…
誰かが困ってるって聞くと助けにいく優しさ…
目を見張るほど鮮やかで強靭な剣の技…
私は…
リンクが…
リンクが最後に見せた
とても美しい技は回転斬りっていうらしい
…槍で真似してみようかな？","Link came to visit me. It had been ages.
I told him the Lynel of Ploymus Mountain
has been terrorizing everyone lately.
When I said that, he started walking
toward the mountain, without a word.
Spellbound, I followed him there.
When we were almost there, he told me
to turn back. He insisted he would be
fine on his own. I stubbornly stayed.
While I argued, the Lynel attacked us
from behind! I was sure we had met
our end. How silly of me to doubt.
With a sure hand and a fierce gleam in
his eye, Link unsheathed the sword that
seals the darkness and defeated our foe.
His swordsmanship was swift and
graceful. I was fascinated by the
beauty of his movements.
Though I should have been terrified,
I could not help but feel safe in the
presence of my dear friend.
His kindness and determination to help
those in need... His strength and skill...
My heart is drawn to his. I am doomed.
The last beautiful move Link performed
on the mountain is called a Spin Attack.
Perhaps I will attempt it with my spear."
13,Book06,"今日 ようやく御父様は私が神獣の
繰り手になる事を認めて下さった
厄災の脅威は この里にとって人ごとじゃない
…ゾーラも出来る事をやらなきゃいけないって
御父様に涙声で必ず無事に戻って来い と言われ
泣きそうになっちゃって黙って頷いた
セゴンは最後まで不機嫌な顔で天井を見上げ
ムズリも途中で出て行ってしまった…
二人には申し訳ないけれど
やっぱり リンクを助けたい…
そういえば鎧の材料がようやく揃った
そろそろ作り始めなきゃ…","Father has finally given his blessing for
me to pilot the Divine Beast. The threat
of the Calamity can no longer be ignored.
Father said the Zora must play their part.
He seemed on the brink of tears when
he made me promise to return unharmed.
My eyes burned with tears as well, so I
simply nodded. Seggin could hardly
look at me. Muzu left partway through.
I feel awful for putting them through this,
but I must do what I can to help Link.
I could never forgive myself otherwise.
Speaking of Link... I have at last finished
gathering the materials for the armor.
I shall start making it at once."
14,Book07,"今日は ハイラル城で叙任式だった
でも…
正直言って式のことは あまり覚えてない…
その後に とってもいい事があったから
初めての体験だったし ドキドキしたし
きっと一生の想い出になると思う
私の御願いを聞いてくれた姫様と 
あの時の ダルケルさんに感謝…
でも そんな嬉しい気持ちが吹き飛んじゃう位
びっくりする噂を聞いた
リンクが姫様御付の騎士に選ばれるらしい…","Today was the inauguration ceremony
at Hyrule Castle. It was an honor to
take part. However...
Honestly, I do not remember much
about it, but only because something
unforgettable happened afterward.
I experienced something wondrous,
a beautiful moment in time I shall
treasure forever.
I am grateful to the princess for agreeing
to my request, and to Daruk for...um...
well, for bringing me closer to Link.
Oh... I did hear something that shocked
me enough to almost overshadow that
happy moment.
Link has been chosen to guard the
princess wherever she goes. They shall...
be spending much time together..."
15,Book08,"やっとリンクにぴったりの鎧が完成した

今度 リンクがゾーラの里にやって来るらしい
本当にこれ渡していいのかな… 
でも昔々 ハイリア人の剣士に恋をした
ゾーラの御姫様もいたらしいし…
今回はリンクも姫様の御伴じゃないから
時間とれそうだし…
そうだ…
夕方 リンクと一緒にルッタに乗ろう
昔々のゾーラの御姫様…
私に勇気をください","I finally completed that special armor
for Link. I am confident it will fit
him perfectly.
He is coming to the domain soon. I hope
to give him my gift when I see him, but...
should I really go through with it?
According to the old legend, long ago a
Zora princess fell in love with a Hylian
swordsman. Perhaps there is hope.
This will be a rare occasion that Link
is not accompanying the princess.
We should have some time to ourselves.
Oh, I have an idea! At sunset I shall ride
upon Ruta with Link. Zora princess of
the past...please lend me your courage!"
