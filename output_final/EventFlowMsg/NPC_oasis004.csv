考えてたわけさぁ","The temperature in the Gerudo Desert
swings dramatically between the day and
night.
If you haven't got the right clothing for
hot and cold weather, your health will
certainly suffer.
Spend too much time in a temperature
you can't handle and your goose is
cooked. Or frozen, I guess.
Even horses don't like going into the
desert. That really tells you something...

And of course, when you add monsters
to that mix... It's just a nightmare of a
place.
That's what got me thinking that having a
legendary sword would make a serious
difference. I'd be safe with that."

イヤなんだよなぁ","I'm talking about the legendary sword
that's supposedly sleeping in a forest in
Hyrule, awaiting its owner's return.
I thought it was a pretty well-known
story... You've never heard it?

Well, anyway... I think it's in the
Great Hyrule Forest in the Eldin region.

Fairies live there, and someone once told
me that if you enter their forest, they'll
get you all turned around and confused.
If the legendary sword does exist, I'd
love to even just get to see it, just once.

But I get lost in the woods when there
aren't fairies messing with me, so I'd
never survive the Great Hyrule Forest..."

持って来いの場所だと思うんだよなぁ
…でもオレ迷うの嫌だから
行かないけどさぁ","You've never heard of the legendary
sword? The one that can only be wielded
by the chosen hero? Weird...
Well, personally, I think it must be in the
Great Hyrule Forest in the Eldin region.

I mean, the whole reason they call it the
Lost Woods is because you always lose
your way and end up back at the start.
If someone wanted to hide a legendary
sword, is there really a better place than
that to do it?
But I get lost in the woods without magic
making it happen, so there's no way I'm
going in there."

箱入り息子なんだよなぁ

でもさぁ伝説の剣があれば
オレだって…","Yeah, I could forget about it...
It is either blazing hot in the day or
bitterly cold at night.
If you haven't got the right clothing for
hot and cold weather, you're just
throwing your life away...
And of course, when you add monsters
just rolling around all over the place...

Ugh, I must sound like such a sheltered
person right now. I'm just not one to
pick a fight I can't win, you know?
Although... If I had that legendary sword,
then maybe even I would stand a
chance..."

The desert also gets hot during the day,

まだ マシかもしれないけどさ","It's starting to get colder... Is this when
I'm supposed to go into the desert?

It doesn't feel so bad right now, but the
desert gets really, really cold at night.

You've absolutely got to have clothing
that resists the cold weather, or you'll be
in serious trouble.
Oh, and there are more monsters out at
night too. Desert monsters are
particularly fierce, I've heard.
If only I had that legendary sword...
I'm sure I'd be all right then..."

It gets scorching hot during the day and
freezing cold at night. And then there are
all the monsters to worry about, too...
If you dress right, you can mitigate
how much the climate affects you,
of course.
But with the gear I've got, those
monsters would have me for lunch faster
than you can say, \""AHHHHHHHHHHHH!\""
*ahem* It'd be a different story if I had
that legendary sword I keep hearing
everyone talk about..."
