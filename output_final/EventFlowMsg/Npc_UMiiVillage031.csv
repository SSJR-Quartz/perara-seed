38,talk00,さて次なんだが…,"Well, next is..."
39,talk01,また会ったな,We meet again.
40,talk02,サクラダ工務店の大工 エノキダだ,"I'm one of the Bolson Construction
contractors. The name's Hudson."
41,talk03,俺もだ,Me too.
42,talk04,"辞令により ここで一から村を作ることにした

村の名前は…""イチカラ村だ","Since I've been transferred here, I've
decided to build a village from scratch.

Every village needs a name, though.
I think I'll call it...Tarrey Town."
43,talk05,しかし…,However...
44,talk06,"会社の在庫で家一軒建てられたものの
村を作るには何もかも足りない","I built a house to store the village
supplies in, but there just isn't enough..."
45,talk07,人モノ金,"Enough anything... People...
Money... Stuff..."
46,talk08,"……やめておけ""得する事は何も無い","But why? There's nothing in it
for you."
47,talk09,助かる…,You're a lifesaver...
48,talk10,"じゃ早速だが
人を呼ぶにも住む家が必要だ
なので薪の束を10本""持って来てくれないか？","Well...I suppose to get started, we'll
need houses for people to live in. We
can't invite them until we have homes.
Do you think you can bring me
10 bundles of wood?"
49,talk11,"それだけあれば会社の在庫と合わせて
新しい家を建てられるはずだ","If you bring me that, I can combine
it with what I've already got and get
started on new houses."
50,talk12,"薪の束を10本""持って来てくれたのか？",Did you bring the 10 bundles of wood?
51,talk13,"その薪の束""もらってもいいのか？",Excellent! Can I have them?
52,talk14,"取り急ぎ薪の束を10本""持って来てくれ","Hurry up and bring me 10 bundles of
wood, will you? I want to get to building."
53,talk15,"今の会社の在庫だけでは
家が建てられんのでな","I haven't got enough supplies in the
storehouse to build houses yet."
54,talk16,"腕っぷしが強いと言えば
ゴロン族が真っ先に挙がるが…","Yeah, if we're talking about brute
physical strength, and we are, a Goron
would be my first choice..."
55,talk17,"ここらの岩をどかして
土地を作りたい
なので ここの岩を壊せる様な
腕っぷしの強いヤツを探してくれないか？","These boulders are driving me nuts.
I want to move them out of the way so
we can develop the land underneath.
It'd really help me out if you could find
someone with enough brute physical
strength to bust them apart."
56,talk18,おっと それから…,"Oh, and one last wrinkle..."
57,talk19,"サクラダ工務店の社是に則り
名前の最後が「ダ」で終わらないと ダメだ
世界のどこかに そんなヤツが居たら
このイチカラ村に来るよう言ってくれ","Yeah, in accordance with the official
Bolson Construction policy, that
someone's name must end in \""son.\""
If you run into anyone that fits with what
I've said, send them here to
Tarrey Town for me."
58,talk21,"ゴロン族を連れてきてくれたんだな
ありがとう
流石ゴロン族だ…確かな腕っぷし
すごい勢いで岩を撤去してくれている
名前もグレーダとププンダで申し分ない

岩を壊したら出た鉱石を ププンダが売り始めた
また挨拶するといいだろう","You sent some Gorons back here.
That's perfect. The brute strength of a
Goron is undeniable.
Those boulders don't stand a chance
against them... And with names like
Greyson and Pelison, they'll fit right in.
Also, Pelison started selling the ore
found within the boulders.
You should go say hello again."
59,talk22,"もっと人を呼ぶためには住む家が必要だ
なので薪の束を20本""持って来てくれないか？","So before more people can move here,
we need homes for them to live in.
Can you bring me 20 bundles of wood?"
60,talk23,"薪の束を20本""持って来てくれたのか？",Did you bring the 20 bundles of wood?
61,talk24,"取り急ぎ薪の束を20本""持って来てくれ","Hurry up and bring me 20 bundles of
wood, will you? I want to get to building."
62,talk25,"裁縫が上手と言えば…
ゲルド族を当たれば居るかも知れないが…","If we're talking about tailoring...
there could be someone among the
Gerudo who's good at that."
63,talk26,"一日中作業をしていたら
すぐに作業着が傷んでしまってな…
なので裁縫が上手なヤツを
探してくれないか？","Working such long hours every day really
wears on my clothes.

Could you look for someone who's got a
gift for tailoring for me?"
64,talk27,"サクラダ社長とカツラダが
来てくれたようだが長旅の疲れが出たようだ
式なら別の日にやればいい","Karson and President Bolson 
just arrived. I can only imagine how tired
they are from their long journey.
We should hold the ceremony on
another day."
65,talk28,"おまえも今日は休むがいい

宿なら そこのカポーダの宿に行けば
タダで泊まらせてくれるだろう","You should take today to rest, too.


If you need a place to stay, talk to
Kapson. He'll probably let you stay for
free."
66,talk29,"社長とカツラダの事を考えて
式は別の日にする","Think of how tired the big boss and
Karson must be. Let's have the
ceremony on another day."
67,talk30,"神父ができそうな神聖な種族と言えば
ゾーラ族が真っ先に挙がるが…","If we're looking for a people
devout enough to have a priest-like
person...I'd suggest the Zora."
68,talk31,"ゲルド族を連れてきてくれたんだな
ありがとう
早速作業着を繕ってもらった
しかも いい匂いがする
名前もパウダで申し分ない

彼女は裁縫の腕を活かし服屋を開業したようだ
また挨拶するといいだろう","You found someone from the Gerudo.
Thank you.

She was able to patch every last hole in
my work clothes before I could blink.
She's pretty...er, amazing!
And since her name is Rhondson, I have
no objections.

I hear she's decided to continue putting
her skills to use by opening a clothing
shop. You should stop by and say hello."
69,talk32,"人を呼ぶためには さらに住む家が必要だ
なので薪の束を30本""持って来てくれないか？","So before more people can move here,
we need more homes for them to live in.
Can you bring me 30 bundles of wood?"
70,talk33,"薪の束を30本""持って来てくれたのか？",Did you bring the 30 bundles of wood?
71,talk34,"取り急ぎ薪の束を30本""持って来てくれ","Hurry up and bring me 30 bundles of
wood, will you? I want to get to building."
72,talk35,"物流と言えば…リト族なら飛び回って
いろいろ仕入れられそうなもんだが…","Oh, that's a good thought...
Rito can fly around, so they should be
able to retrieve and deliver supplies."
73,talk36,"いよいよ村らしくしたいのだが
そのためには物流を作らないとな
そんな訳で よろず屋を招きたいんだが
俺達にはそのノウハウも物流のコネも無い
なので物流も含めて
よろず屋ができそうなヤツを探してくれないか？","It's finally starting to look like a town
around here. Which is exactly why we
need to set up some distribution.
I'd like to get a general store up and
running, but there's no one with the
connections and qualifications to run it.
Do you think you could keep an eye out
for someone who knows about
distribution and can run a general store?"
74,talk37,そんなに都合よく居るもんだろうか…,"Good luck! You'll need it... This seems
like a real long shot."
75,talk38,ありがとう,Thank you.
76,talk39,"リト族を連れてきてくれたんだな
ありがとう
早速開業してもらった
実家が よろず屋らしいな
名前もペーダで申し分ない

彼自身が飛び回り仕入れた物を売っている
また見て行くといいだろう","You managed to find a Rito and bring him
back here. Thank you.

He wasted no time getting a general
store up and running—apparently his
family runs one too.
And with a name like Fyson,
he'll fit right in!

He's selling things that he's picked up
while flying around. You should really go
check out the store."
77,talk40,"もっと人を呼ぶためには さらに家が必要だ
なので薪の束を50本""持って来てくれないか？","So before we can call more people here,
we need even more homes for them.
Can you bring me 50 bundles of wood?"
78,talk41,"薪の束を50本""持って来てくれたのか？",Did you bring the 50 bundles of wood?
79,talk42,"取り急ぎ薪の束を50本""持って来てくれ","Hurry up and bring me 50 bundles of
wood, will you? I want to get to building."
80,talk43,さて次は手前味噌なんだが…,"I actually wanted to talk about something
a little personal..."
81,talk44,婚約した,"Oh, not that kind of personal.
Actually, I got engaged."
82,talk45,本当だ,It's true.
83,talk46,そこのパウダだ,To Rhondson.
84,talk47,ありがとう,Thank you.
85,talk48,余計なお世話だ,"You say that, but for some reason, I
think you mean the opposite..."
86,talk49,"しかし式を挙げるにも
神父が居ない事には話にならん
なので 
神父ができそうなヤツを探してくれないか？","Anyway, we want to have a little
ceremony to celebrate, but we need
someone priest-like to officiate.
Could you look for someone priest-like
for us?"
87,talk50,この度 パウダと結婚する事になった,Now Rhondson and I can be married!
88,talk51,"ゾーラ族を連れてきてくれたんだな
ありがとう
聞けば彼は
現役時代神父だったらしいな
名前もカポーダで申し分ない

しかし…よくもまぁ これだけ都合よく
名前の最後が「ダ」の者が居たもんだ","You found a Zora? Thank you...really.


He and I talked earlier, and he said that
he literally was a priest before he retired.
You can't get more priest-like than that.
And his name is Kapson, so I have no
objections there.

It really is amazing that you were able to
find someone priest-like who also had
an acceptable name..."
89,talk52,"後は式を挙げるだけだが
来賓を招かないとな","Of course, we'll have to invite guests in
order to hold a ceremony..."
90,talk53,社長のサクラダと後輩のカツラダだ,"Well, I'm talking about my boss, Bolson,
and my subordinate, Karson."
91,talk54,"しかし式の準備もあって多忙でな…
代わりに呼びに行ってくれないか？","However, I've got to prepare for the
ceremony, so my hands are full...
Could you invite them for me?"
92,talk55,それじゃあ頼んだぞ,Excellent. I'm counting on you.
93,talk56,"サクラダ社長と カツラダが来たら
式を開始する
居場所は おそらくハテノ村だ
俺の代わりに呼んできてくれないか","Once Karson and the boss Bolson get
here, we can start the ceremony.

They're probably still in Hateno Village.
Can you invite them for me?"
94,talk57,二人を誘ってくれたんだなありがとう,"You extended my invitation for me.
Thank you."
95,talk58,"さて サクラダ社長とカツラダが
首を長くして待っている
式を始めるか","Now then, Karson and the boss Bolson
are waiting for things to begin...

Shall we start the ceremony?"
96,talk59,"分かった
心の準備が出来たら呼んでくれ","I understand... This is an exciting event
for me too. When you've collected
yourself, come talk to me."
97,talk60,"承知した

じゃ列に並んでくれ","Understood.


Then let's join the gathering."
98,talk79,…そうだこれを受け取ってくれ,All right. This is for you.
99,talk80,"参列してくれてありがとう
…グスン","Thank you for attending the ceremony.
...*sniff*"
100,talk81,…目にゴミが入っただけだ,What? No. Just something in my eye...
101,talk82,"さてイチカラ村だが すっかり村らしくなった

全てはおまえのおかげだ礼を言う","And now Tarrey Town looks like a real
town at long last.

This was all possible because of you. 
I can't thank you enough for all the hard
work you did."
102,talk83,"ここの岩をどけている時に出たものだ

俺やパウダには こういうのは必要ない
持って行け","These were found inside the boulders we
smashed when we were clearing land.

Rhondson and I have no use for them.
You can take them."
103,talk84,"…と思ったが
ダイヤモンド3個は持てないみたいだな
売るなり捨てるなりして また来るといい","Well, I want to give them to you, but it
looks like you haven't got room
for three diamonds."
104,talk85,おまえか,It's you.
105,talk86,やぁ,Hey.
106,talk87,"俺はここでパウダと暮らす

おまえは…
やる事があるんだろう？","Rhondson and I are very happy to live
here now.

So... Isn't there something important
you should be doing?"
107,talk88,"だったら早く行け

おまえは世界を股に掛ける漢
こんな小さな村に留まる器ではないはずだ","Then get to it.


You've traveled the world helping folks,
but there's more that need helping. You
don't have the luxury of tarrying here."
108,talk89,"そうか…
だったら ゆっくりしていくといい","I see... In that case, stay as long as you
like, OK?"
109,talk90,ほぅ,Oh.
110,talk91,どうも,Hello.
111,talk95,"おい…

ヒントも何も社長とカツラダなら
ハテノ村に居るだろう？","You know where they are. The boss and
Karson are in Hateno Village, right?"
