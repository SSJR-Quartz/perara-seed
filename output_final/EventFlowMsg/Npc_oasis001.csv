Sarqso."
14,Com_Talk_04,"迷うしぐさも ヴォーイを射止める技の1つ

That truly makes a vai beautiful."

私にとっては嬉しい物だったりするんですもの","It's interesting how one vai's trash

that. I really am sorry..."
22,Com_Talk_16,"ここで脱ぐのかしら？
それは美しいヴァーイとは言えないわね…","You're going to undress here? Even for
a vai as beautiful as yourself, there are
some societal rules you should follow..."
23,Com_Talk_33,"を1つだけね？
それならルピーでいい？","Just one, right?
In that case, how's  rupees
sound to you?"
24,Com_Talk_35,"を個全部ね？

ルピーで貴女のものにできるわよ",That can be yours for  rupees. 
26,Com_Talk_61,"ふふ ゆっくり選んでいってちょうだい

色々ありがとう
貴女はいつでも特別価格よ

気に入ったアクセサリーがあったら
遠慮なく手に取ってみてね","Thanks to your hard work, our lives are
finally back to normal. Sarqso!

To show my thanks, I'll offer you a
special price. Just pick up any accessory
you're interested in."
28,Talk002,"店が再開して マッカラもアクセサリー作り
張り切ってるわ
ほんとにサークサーク","Ever since reopening the shop, Cara
has been enthusiastic about making
accessories, too!
I'm incredibly grateful! Sarqso!"
29,Talk006,ふふっ サークサーク,"Heehee, sarqso."
30,Talk007,"宝石にはそれぞれ力が宿っててね
身に着けるとその加護が受けられるの
たとえば…ルビーなら耐寒の力
サファイアなら耐暑の力… とかね
私はその力を利用して
サークレットやイヤリングを作ってるの
ただ材料の入手が難しくて…

だからウチは材料と交換して作るスタイルに
させていただいてるの","You see, each gem contains its own
special power. Wearing one will grant you
a form of protection.
For example, sapphires offer resistance
to intense heat, and rubies have the
power to resist chilling temperatures.
I'm able to craft circlets or earrings that
channel these powers to protect the
wearer.
Sadly, the materials to make such items
are difficult to get ahold of... That's why
you have to bring me the materials."
31,Talk008,"手間はかかるけど
それ以上に満足していただけるはずよ
それに うちのアクセサリーは
ユニセックスだから
ヴォーイへのプレゼントとしても
喜ばれてるのよ","It'll take some time, but there's nothing
that'll satisfy you more than that.

Oh, and don't forget that voe and vai
alike can enjoy these. They're great gifts
if you want to impress someone, hehe."
32,Talk009,"またどうぞ
何事も売り時を逃さないようにね","Come again!
Don't ever pass up a chance to sell
something!"
33,Talk012,"火打ち石も十分あるし
今日からは休まず営業するわよ
アクセサリーが欲しいなら
商品を直接選んでくれるかしら？","I have enough flint now, so I can work
every day! If you want any accessories,
could you pick them yourself?"
34,Talk013,"美しいものを身に着けると
ヴァーイはより輝く…
貴女を輝かせるアクセサリーに出会ったら
教えてくれるかしら？","When a vai wears something beautiful,
it makes her absolutely sparkle.

Can you let me know if you see
an accessory that makes you
sparkle?"
35,Talk014,"宝石とヴァーイは惹かれあう…

貴女がコレだと思ったものが
運命のアクセサリーよ
気になるのがあったら
直接選んで教えてくれるかしら？","There is a certain special connection
between a vai and fine jewelry.

Whatever accessory you feel a tie to...
That is your destined accessory.

If there's anything that catches your eye,
can you let me know?"
36,Talk015,"貴女がいなかったら
このお店どうなってたことか…
本当に サークサーク","I don't know what would have happened 
to my shop without you!
I'm incredibly grateful! Sarqso!"
37,Talk016,"ふふっ貴女に宝石のご加護が
ありますように…","Heehee. May you have the protection of
the gems."
38,Talk017,"サークサーク！
そのアクセサリー貴女のイメージにピッタリよ","Sarqso! That accessory really is your
style!"
39,Talk018,"サークサーク
その宝石のご加護がありますように…","Sarqso. May you have the
protection of that gem."
40,Talk019,"神獣は大人しくなったけど
お陰で街の中が騒がしくなっちゃったわね
ふふっ私知ってるのよ…
貴女が今回の神獣鎮圧に関わってるってこと…
自分の手柄をひけらかさない
その奥ゆかしさ…私も見習わなくっちゃね
それで… ゲルドを救ったヒロインが
私に何かご用かしら？","With the Divine Beast calmed, the town
has really returned to its lively self.

Oh, but don't think I don't know... You
played a part in calming the Divine
Beast...
You're not the type to brag about your
accomplishments, though. I can tell.
I could learn a thing or two from you...
Anyway... What does the heroine of
Gerudo Town need from me today,
I wonder?"
41,Talk020,"私が貴女だったら
ゲルドの街を救ったヒロインとして
銅像ぐらい作ってもらうけどね…
ふふっ もちろん宝石いっぱいちりばめてね","If I were you, I'd have had them put up a
great big statue in honor of my saving
Gerudo Town...
Heheh, and it would be absolutely
covered in jewels, of course."
42,Talk021,ヴァーサーク,Vasaaq.
