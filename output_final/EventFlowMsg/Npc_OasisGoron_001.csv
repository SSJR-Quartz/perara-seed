1,talk00,"ゲルドの街って
ホント女の子ばっかりだゴロ
いい匂いだゴロ～

……

僕…
なんで入れちゃったゴロン？","Gerudo Town really is full of women,
isn't it?

It really smells nice here...


Hang on... I thought men weren't
allowed in this town...
Why did they let me in?"
2,talk01,"1人で女の子に囲まれて
ずっと恥ずかしかったゴロ
でも…ストラドンが来ても
やっぱり恥ずかしいゴロね…","I was really shy, being all by myself and
surrounded by girls like that.

Being honest... Even with Strade here,
I still feel pretty shy..."
3,talk02,"えっと… サヴァサヴ…？ サブォ…？
…とりあえず コンバンハだゴロ
「ヴァ！」とか「ヴォ！」とか
ゲルドの言葉は覚えにくいゴロ…","Um... Savasava? Sava...sotta?
Anyway, good evening!

Gerudo words are really hard to
remember. I think \""sav\"" is part of half of
them, but there's some starting with V..."
4,talk03,"えっと… サボッタ？
…ちがう サヴォッタだったゴロ
「ボ」とか「バ」は下唇をかんで
「ブォ」とか「ヴァ」とかにするらしいゴロ
この前 ゲルドの子に怒られたゴロ…

でも正直…
どっちでも同じに聞こえるゴロ…","Er... Sa...botta?
Was that it? I can't tell...

Apparently you really have to bite your
lip to get that V sound out clearly.

A little kid made fun of me yesterday for
not being able to get the pronunciation
right.
I don't know why, but it sounds the same
to me no matter what I do..."
5,talk04,"えっと… サヴァーク！

「ヴァ！」とか「ヴォ！」とか
ゲルドの言葉は わかりにくいけど
これだけは覚えたゴロ","Uhh... Sav'aaq!
That V sound is really tricky to master...
I feel like I got it there, though."
6,talk05,"サヴァーク！
やっと普通に挨拶できるようになったゴロ","Sav'aaq! See, I can do it right!"
7,talk06,"サヴォッタ！
やっと覚えたゴロ",Sav'otta! Hah! I got it!
8,talk07,"サヴァサーヴァ！

あっ違った
サヴァサーバだったゴロ…
ここは「ヴァ」じゃなく「バ」らしいゴロ…

やっぱりゲルド語は難しいゴロ…","Sav'saava!


Oh, wait... I think there's supposed to be
a B sound there? Is it sab'saava?
Sav'saaba?
Ugh, this language is hard..."
