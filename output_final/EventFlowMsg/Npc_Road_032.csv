But it's another story when they cheat
and catch you by surprise."

trouble here."
4,Failed01,"うう…ここで倒れでもしたら
私の重大な任務が志半ばで…","Whew... I'm on an important mission.
Those things almost got in the way of it."
5,MSG_Gerud_00,"今のところ この街に
怪しい者が紛れ込んでいる気配はなさそうだ
まだ気は抜けんがな","I've been watching, and I feel safe

keep my eyes open."
7,MSG_Gerud_01,"ナボリスの出現で
この辺りは危険な状態だ
砂漠を知り尽くす我らゲルド族でも
避けているほどだ
おまえもナボリスの雷で黒焦げになる前に
カラカラバザールにでも引き返すんだな","Ever since Naboris showed up again,
we've had no end of problems here.

Anyone who knows anything about the
desert, like my people, takes pains to
avoid the thing.
You should get to safety somewhere like
Kara Kara Bazaar before Naboris's
lightning strikes you down."

だが賊の残党が
いつこの街に戻ってくるか わからんからな
まだまだ気は抜けん","I've been watching, and I feel safe
saying there's no one suspicious
around here.
That doesn't mean I can relax, though.

まだこんな所にいるのか？
まったく…
ナボリスの雷で黒焦げになっても知らんからな","You're still here? Don't you understand
the dangers?Sa'oten! Don't blame me if Naboris's
lightning strikes you down."
11,MSG_Gerud_01_2,"ナボリスの脅威は去ったようだが
砂漠はいつも危険と隣り合わせ
我らゲルド族でも気を抜くと
大ケガをすることもある
おまえも砂漠を渡るなら
装備を整えてしっかり準備をしておくことだな","Naboris has stopped terrorizing the
desert, but that doesn't mean it's a safe
place now. Not even for us Gerudo.
If you intend to travel the desert,
be sure that you're equipped for
the journey."

今のところ怪しい者の気配はないが

of a long journey, huh? WRONG! That's
what the Yiga Clan WANTS you to think!"

22,Near03,今夜も冷えるな…,Tonight's chilly again.
23,Rest_00,"ふぅ… この地の治安のためとはいえ
通常の警備だと街の外までは行かんからな
さすがに少し疲れたよ","*sigh* Most guards don't stray too far
from town.They claim it's to keep a close eye on
things there, but I suspect it's so they
don't wear themselves out walking."
24,RetMSG_Gerud_00,"今のところ この街に
怪しい者が紛れ込んでいる気配はなさそうだ
他の兵士達は イーガ団のアジトを叩くべく

まぁナボリスのことは族長様が
何とかしてくれるはずだが
命が惜しければ
それまでは大人しくしとくんだな","Don't blame me if you go wandering the
deserts and Naboris's lightning strikes
you down.
We Gerudo know better than to go
anywhere near that thing.I heard our chief might be doing
something about Naboris, but...until
she does, be smart and stay away."

砂嵐には十分気を付けるんだぞ
方向感覚が失われ気がつけば見知らぬ場所…
なんてことも よくあるからな

into the desert: there are sandstorms out
there so thick you can't tell vai from voe.

suspicious characters."

変装の名人だったとしたら
旅人が集まる馬宿が
一番身を隠しやすい場所だと思わんか？
だからこの辺りも しっかり見張っておかんとな

アイツらも まさか我々の方も
旅人に変装しているとは思わんだろう","If the tip I heard is true about the Yiga
Clan being masters of disguise, they
could be anyone here at this stable.
I can't afford to let my guard slip for
even a moment.Sooner or later, they'll mistake me for
a simple traveler, and that's when I'll
have them dead to rights."
36,RetMSG_Gerud_0400_1,"イーガ団が噂通り
変装の名人だとしても
まさか我々まで

their prey being in disguise too. Heheh."

私も まだまだだな","I shouldn't have had so much trouble
with a weakling. I'm supposed to be
better than that."

命拾いしたよ サークサーク！","That was a hot one, even for the desert.
I wouldn't have made it without your
help. Sarqso!"

41,SavedLv2_01,"その腕前は もしかして
イーガ団…
…よりも強いんじゃないか？","The way you fight... I've never seen
anyone that good. Not even the
Yiga Clan."
42,SavedLv3_00,"助かったよ

いつもの装備だったら
あの程度の魔物に負けはしないんだが…","I hate this... That should have been no
problem, but here we are.

If I had my usual gear, no monster that
small would dare approach me."
43,SavedLv3_01,"その戦い慣れした感じは
おまえはもしかして…イーガ団？
なわけないか！
イーガ団が人助けするはずないからな","You seem at home in battle. You're...not
a member of the Yiga Clan, are you?Hah, what am I saying? As if any of
those jackals would go to the trouble
of saving me."

受け取ってくれ","I have to thank you somehow. Is this
enough?"
45,first,"……

うむ…
おまえは普通の旅人のようだな！
すまんなこう見えて実は私…
ゲルドの街の兵士なんだ
街の平和を脅かす
イーガ団という賊がいるんだが
そいつらのお陰で今ゲルドの街は
大変なことになっているんだ
そいつらは旅人に変装し
悪事を働くという噂があってな
だから私もこうやって旅人になりすまし
賊が紛れ込んでいないか見張っているんだ","Hmmmm... You look like your everyday
traveler, but how can I be sure?Don't tell anyone...but I'm no merchant.
I'm a Gerudo Town soldier in disguise.Ever heard of the Yiga Clan? They're a
group of thieving bandits who have
caused all sorts of trouble back in town.
I got a tip that some of them go
incognito as travelers to ambush
the unwary.
That's why I'm dressed as a simple
merchant. My mission is to blend in
and stay on guard in case they strike.
They were bold enough to strike at
Gerudo Town, so I wouldn't be shocked
if they struck at travelers, too..."
