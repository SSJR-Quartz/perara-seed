10,talk02,おはようございます,Good morning.
11,talk03,こんにちは,Hello.
12,talk04,こんばんは,Good evening.
13,talk05,どなた…？,You are?
14,talk07,ハァ…また夜に パパに相談しないと…,"*sigh* At night, I've got to ask Papa for
advice again..."
15,talk08,私にご用ですか？,Do you need something from me?
16,talk09,はい…,Yes...
17,talk10,"私もそろそろ寝ようかしら…

あっ…つい独り言を…","I think I'll go to sleep...


Oops! There I go, talking to myself..."
18,talk11,"病気がちな娘のために
夫がここに別荘を買ってくれたんです
イチカラ村は いいですね
人も少ないし空気もきれいで…
主人の強引なやり方は好きじゃないのですが
今度ばかりは正解でした
娘も少しよくなったように思うんです

後は…たくさん食べるようになってくれれば
すぐにでも回復すると思うのですが…","Our daughter has been in poor health
lately... My husband believed that moving
here could help, so he bought a house.
I do like it here... The air is clean. There
aren't too many people... 

Despite my husband's determination, I
wasn't sure if a move was a good idea...
but our daughter is slowly improving.
The only thing left is for her appetite to
return. I'm sure she'd get well faster if
she ate more."
19,talk12,"ええ…お気遣い無く

でも娘が もっと
食べてくれるようになると いいんですけど…","Yes... Don't worry yourself.


I only wish that my daughter would eat
more and recover her strength..."
20,talk13,"ごめんなさい…内輪の話なので
ご退出願えますか？","I'm sorry... This is a very personal matter.
Could you leave, please?"
21,talk14,"この子…ケーキなら食べられるのよ
何とかならないの？","Our daughter... The only thing she'll eat
is cake. Can't anything be done?"
22,talk15,"しかし世界中のありとあらゆるケーキを
食べさせたじゃないですか…
今まで どれだけかかったと思ってるんですか…","We've scoured the world, searching for a
cake that would please her. None have.
Imagine how much money we've spent..."
23,talk16,"まぁ パパったら！
お金と娘 どっちが大事なの？！
…分かったわ こうなったら

私は魔物に魂を売ってでも
この子が回復するケーキを手に入れますから！","Papa, excuse me!
What's more important to you, money or
our daughter?
...I see. If that's the case...


Even if I have to sell my soul to a
monster, I'll get my hands on a cake
that can cure our daughter!"
24,talk17,魔物とか…ママは無茶苦茶です…,"You're talking about monsters now...
This is absolutely insane, Mama..."
25,talk18,"何ですかこれ…？
マモノケーキって言うんですか？
これを…娘に？","What is... Is this a monster cake?


I should give this to my daughter?"
26,talk19,"ありがとうございます！

あのマモノケーキ
娘は すごい勢いで平らげてました
おかげで体力も回復したようです！
本当に何と言ったらいいか…
…そうそう
これは少ないけど お礼です","Thank you so much!


That monster cake... Our daughter
wolfed it down with unbelievable gusto.
It seems her health has returned to her!
I don't even know what to say—I'm just
so thankful! Oh, I know. This isn't much,
but please take it."
27,talk20,"娘には…
あなたからも声をかけてあげてくださいね","Could you maybe...try talking to her
some time, as well."
28,talk21,あっあなたは…！,"Ah, you're..."
29,talk22,"ありがとうございます
それにしても すごい臭い…
なんて言ってられませんね
このケーキで娘が回復してくれれば…
ともかく ありがとうございます","Thank you so much!
Oh, wow. It's certainly quite pungent...
Phew.
I suppose I can't complain about things
like that. If our daughter can get better
thanks to this cake..."
30,talk23,早速食べさせてみますね,I'll try to get her to eat it right away.
31,talk24,早速起こして食べさせてみますね,"I'll wake her up right away and try to get
her to eat it."
32,talk25,その節は ありがとうございました,Thank you for all of your help.
