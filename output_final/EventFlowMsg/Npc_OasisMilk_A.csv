早く教えてよ ヤイドラ～！","Forget her! Just hurry up and tell
us the password, Yaido!"
3,Talk_02,"そうそう合言葉ね

GSC◆なんだって
サジュの話を盗み聞きしたから間違いないよ！","Oh, that's right, the password!
It's GSC◆. I overheard Saula talking
about it, so I'm sure that's right!"
4,Talk_03,"Gerudo Secret Clubで
GSCかぁ～ なるほどね～
でも最後の◆は何なんだろうね…","GSC◆? What could that... Oh, I get it.
Gerudo Secret Club—GSC. But what's the
◆ at the end mean?"
5,Talk_04,さぁ…,Who knows...
6,Talk_05,"ねぇねぇ 
ファッションパッションの噂""知ってる？","Hey, have you heard the rumor about
Fashion Passion?"
7,Talk_06,知ってる～,I have!
8,Talk_07,"サジュに それとなく聞いてみたんだけどさ
全然教えてくれないんだ","I tried asking Saula about it indirectly,
but she wouldn't tell me anything."
9,Talk_08,"サジュって ファッションパッションの店員の？
え～ それって余計に怪しいじゃん","Doesn't Saula work at Fashion Passion?
Geez, that's extremely suspicious..."
10,Talk_09,"でさ～
キャリバンの事だけどさ～",So about Calyban...
11,Talk_10,"あ～ あの子
ほんとに最近見ないよね～","Oh, yeah! I haven't seen her around at
all lately..."
12,Talk_11,"うん極度のめんどくさがり屋だったから
旅に出たわけでも なさそうだし
どこに行ったんだろうね～","I wonder where she's at... She's the
laziest person I know, so she couldn't
have gone all that far..."
13,Talk_12,塀の上とか？,"Maybe to the top of the wall or
something?"
14,Talk_13,"何それ～
ありえないでしょ？","What are you talking about? Why would
she go up there? Don't be silly."
15,Talk_14,ペディ元気でやってるかなぁ～,I wonder how Perda's doing...
16,Talk_15,真剣にラブポンド探してたもんね～,"She was so enthusiastic about searching
for Lover's Pond..."
17,Talk_16,"フィローネ地方にあるはずだって
飛び出して行ったっきりだからね～","And she took off so quickly when she
heard it was somewhere in Faron..."
18,Talk_17,"えっ？フィローネにあるの？
てっきり単なる噂だとばかり思ってたけど？","What? It's definitely in Faron? I was
pretty sure that was just a rumor..."
19,Talk_18,"本当かどうかは わかんないけどさ
帰ってきてないってことは…","Obviously I don't know for sure. But she
hasn't come back yet, which can only
mean one thing..."
20,Talk_19,運命の人に出会えたってこと？,That she met her true love?
21,Talk_20,私も行ってみようかな～,"Maybe I should go out there, too..."
22,TerrorArrow,お落ち着いて！,C-calm down!
23,TerrorBomb,何をする気？,What's the big idea?!
24,TerrorExplosion,きゃぁ！,Eeek!
25,TerrorFire,や やめなさいよ！,S-stop that! Please!
26,TerrorSword,な なんなの？！,Wh-what?!
27,near00,例のウワサ知ってる？,You heard the rumor?
28,near01,あっ そういえばさ…,"Oh, that reminds me..."
29,talk00,"この前さ～
やっと手に入れたんだ例の場所の合言葉","Oh, I was going to tell you... I finally got
my hands on the password for you-
know-where."
30,talk01,"それホント？
アソコって ちょっとヤバいんでしょ？","Seriously? Wow... That place is a little
crazy, isn't it?"
31,talk02,でもちょっと興味ある～,"Maybe, but I'm really interested..."
32,talk03,その合言葉ってのはね…,"Anyway, the password is..."
33,talk04,ねぇ ちょっと待って,Wait a second!
34,talk05,"アンタ！！
堂々と私達の話を聞いてんじゃないわよ
アタシ達は大事な話をしてるんだから
あっち行きなさいよね","You!! Did you really think we wouldn't
see you standing there, listening to our
conversation?!
So rude! This is a private conversation!
Go away!"
35,talk06,"そういえばさ～
キャリバンって最近みないね～","I was just thinking... It's been a while
since I saw Calyban around..."
36,talk07,"確かに街の中で
最近会ったことないかも","Now that you mention it, I don't think
I've seen her in town lately either."
37,talk08,"そういえば
私も見てないかも",Me neither...
38,talk09,もしかしたらさ～,You don't think she's...
39,talk13,"そういえばさ～
ペディって どうしてんだろ？",I wonder what Perda's up to...
40,talk14,"確かラブポンド探しに行くって
言ってたよね？","Didn't she say she was going to look for
Lover's Pond?"
41,talk15,あの運命の人に出会えるって場所でしょ？,"The place that's supposed to be perfect
for meeting your one true love or some
nonsense?"
42,talk16,そうそう その場所ってのがさぁ～,"That's right! I've heard of that place
before. Did you know..."
43,talk17,"なあに？
テーブルの上で踊ってくれるの？
ってか目障りだから
さっさと降りてくれる？","What's this? I hope you aren't planning
on staying up on that table...

You're blocking our view, so hurry up
and get down from there!"
44,talk18,"アンタ！！
上から見下ろしてんじゃないわよ！
そんなとこにいられたんじゃ
話もできやしないじゃない","You!! Don't just stand there looking
at us like that!

How can we have a decent conversation
with you standing there, staring?!"
45,talk19,"テーブルに乗るのが
ハイリア人のマナー？
悪いけど降りてくれる？
邪魔なんだけど？","Is it considered good manners where
you're from to just climb all over the
table?
You're in Gerudo Town now, so could
you please respect our tradition of not
climbing all over tables?"
