8,Revival02,"いい気分だ！！
久々のシャバの空気は最高だねぇ！","Oh, what a feeling! That first breath of
fresh air after an eternity of decay...
It's just so intoxicating!"
9,Revival03,"アンタには世話になったね
おかげで力を取り戻せたよ
さて…今度はアタシの番

材料さえ持って来れば アンタの服を
強くしてやるよ！試してみるかい？","Thanks to you, I've been returned to my
former glory.

And as they say—one good turn deserves
another. I can help you, boy.

Allow me to enhance your clothing.
It's the least I can do, but I will need
the necessary materials..."
10,Talk00,"アンタかい よく来たね！
服を強くしてやろうか？","Ah, welcome back, boy. Do you want
me to enhance your clothing?"
11,Talk01,"もう行っちゃうのかい？
さびしいねぇ…","Going already? How unfortunate
for me..."
12,Talk02,"この世界には アタシと同じように
力を失った姉妹達が居てね
そいつらにも同じように力を与えてくれたら
もっと服を強くできるはずさ","I have sisters out there in the world.
Like me, they've lost much of their
power.
If you were able to restore power to
them as well, we'd then be able to
enhance your clothing even more..."
13,Talk04,さあ できたよ！,All finished!
14,Talk05,他の服も強くしてやろうか？,"Do you want me to enhance any of your
other clothes?"
15,Talk07,"他の服も強くしてやろうかと思ったけど
もう無理みたいだねぇ…","I thought I would improve some other
clothes for you, but it looks like that's
not possible right now."
16,Talk08,強くしたい服は どれだい？,"Which clothing item would you like me
to enhance?"
17,Talk10,"どうして強くできないのか
理由を教えてやろう","Please, let me explain why I cannot
enhance your clothes."
18,Talk11,"…と思ったけど服を一つも持ってない上に
装備もしてないんだね…
強くできそうな服を手に入れたら
また来ておくれ","I'd love to enhance your clothing, but
you don't seem to be carrying any.
Or wearing any for that matter...
If you get your hands on some clothes
that look like they could be enhanced,
come back and visit me again."
19,Talk12,"今のアタシなら アンタの服…
少しだけ""強くしてやれそうだよ","With the power available to me...
I should be able to enhance your
clothing a little bit."
20,Talk13,"今のアタシなら アンタの服…
だいぶ""強くしてやれそうだよ","With the power available to me...
I can enhance your clothing
a fair amount."
21,Talk14,"今のアタシなら アンタの服…
かなり""強くしてやれそうだよ","With the power available to me...
I can greatly enhance your clothing."
22,Talk15,"今のアタシなら アンタの服…
最大まで""強くしてやれそうだよ","With the power available to me...
I can enhance your clothing to the max!"
23,Talk16,"アンタ…姉達にも
ルピーを捧げてくれたんだね
おかげで最高まで服を強くできるから
またいつでも来なよ","You... You gave rupees to my sisters,
as well.

Come back anytime you're looking
to enhance your clothing to the max!"
24,Talk17,じゃあ いくよ…,"All right, let me do my thing!"
25,Talk18,それじゃ…,See you later...
26,Talk19,あっ ふぅ～～……,Ahhh woooo...
27,Talk20,ハァァ～～～…,Haaaaa...
28,Talk21,ふうぅぅ～～っ…,Phoooo...

30,Talk23,そぉ れぇ～～～！！,Haiyah!!
31,Talk24,また～～～！！,Heeeee!!
32,Talk25,ふぅ～～～ん！！,Awaaaay!!
33,Talk26,さよ～なら～～～！！,Good-bye!!
34,Talk27,"そのなら
強くできそうだよ！","I think I can enhance the
."
35,Talk28,を強くするのかい？,"You want me to enhance the
?"
36,Talk29,"強くするのはで
間違い無いかい？","Are you sure you want me to enhance
the ?"
37,Talk30,"分かったよ
を強くするんだね？","All right.
You want to enhance the
, right?"
38,Talk31,"アタシ達の力でも
強くしてやれない服も あるのさ…","There are some clothing items that
can't be enhanced, even with my powers."
39,Talk32,"その服は ちょっと無理みたいだねぇ…
他のは どうだい？","I can't do anything with that clothing
item... How about a different one?"
40,Talk33,"すまないねぇ
その服は強くできないみたいだよ","Sorry, I can't enhance that clothing item."
41,Talk34,"悪いけど その服は
アタシには手に負えないみたいだよ","Sorry, but that particular clothing item
is out of my hands."
42,Talk35,"その服は今のアタシでは無理だよ
もっと姉達の力を借りないとねぇ…","I can't do anything with that clothing
item right now. I would need the help of
my sisters' powers..."
43,Talk36,"無理言わないでおくれ
もっと姉達が解放されれば話は別だけど…","Please don't ask the impossible of me.
If my sisters were released, things might
be different, but..."
44,Talk37,"その服…今は無理だねぇ
姉達が力を取り戻したら強くできるだろうけど","That item... Right now I can't do anything
with it. I could probably enhance it once
my sisters regain their powers."
45,Talk38,"すまないけど その服は
姉達の力を借りないと無理だねぇ…","I'm sorry, but...to enhance that clothing
item, I'd need the aid of my sisters'
powers..."
46,Talk39,おや？材料が足りないみたいだよ？,"Hrm? It seems like you don't have
enough materials..."
47,Talk40,あら？材料が無いと強くできないよ,"Oh... If you don't have the materials,
I can't enhance it."
48,Talk41,"残念だけど材料が足りないみたいだ
他のは どうだい？","It's unfortunate, but you don't have 
enough materials. How about trying
something else?"
49,Talk42,"おっと材料が足りてないよ？
他の服にしなよ","Huh... You don't have enough materials!
Why not try another clothing item?"
50,Talk43,"なんだ…遠慮してるのかい？
他の服でもいいよ？","What now? Are you being modest?
We can try a different clothing item
if you'd like."
51,Talk44,分かったよゆっくり決めておくれ,All right. Take your time.
52,Talk45,間違えたのかい？ しょうがないねぇ…,"You made a mistake? I guess it happens
from time to time..."
53,Talk46,オッケー選び直しておくれ,OK. Go ahead and choose again.
54,Talk47,"…おや？なんだい
今のままだと服を強くできなそうだよ…
一応確認してやろう
手持ちの服を見せておくれ","Hmm? What's this... You don't have any
clothing that I can enhance?
Really?
Let's take a look, just to be sure."
55,Talk48,"服か素材を手に入れるか姉が力を取り戻したら
また ここにおいで","Please come back here once you get
some clothes or materials...or once
you've restored the power of my sisters."
56,Talk49,"新しい服か素材を手に入れたら
また ここにおいで","Please return to me if you get some
strong new clothes or materials."
57,Talk50,"さぁできた！
少しは強くなったね
服を強くするとね特別な力が宿る事があるんだ
同じ種類の服で そろえる必要があるけどね…","All finished!
Just a bit stronger now... Oh...

You've heard about set bonuses, right?
How a set of clothes that have all been
enhanced twice could have a bonus?
But only if you wear the whole set!
Well, and not all sets have a bonus..."
