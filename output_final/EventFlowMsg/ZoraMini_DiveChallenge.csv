5,near00,飛び込む姿は美しい！,Diving is beauty!
6,talk00,やぁ貴殿か！,Hey! It's you!
7,talk01,"貴殿… ドレファン王から
ゾーラの鎧を授かったであろう","Congratulations on the new Zora armor.
It is most impressive indeed."
8,talk02,"小生""人が水面に飛び込む姿こそが
人が一番美しく輝く瞬間だと悟ったのだ","It is my observation that a person's true
colors shine the brightest when they
dive freely into the waves!"
9,talk03,"ゾーラの鎧を着れば ハイリア人でも
滝を登ってすぐに戻って来れるだろうし…","Wearing the Zora armor, even a Hylian
like you can climb a waterfall and get
back up here in no time at all."
10,talk04,"よければ貴殿が水面に飛び込む姿を
小生に見せてくれまいか？
ここから下の池に向かって頭から美しく！
お願いだ！","That said, if you don't mind me asking,
would you please show me your true
colors as you dive into the water?
You can dive headfirst from here into the
water below! It would be true beauty
made flesh! Please consider!"
11,talk05,"さあさあ ここから
飛び込んでくれまいか？","Come now! Won't you please express
your soul's potential with a glorious
dive from here?"
12,talk06,"そして その美しき姿を目に焼き付け
魂の躍動を感じたいのだ","I want nothing more than to witness the
beauty of an effortless and free dive!
To feel it burned on my soul's memory!"
13,talk07,"分かったら ここから下の池へ
飛び込んでくれ！期待しておるぞ！","If you have any soul at all, then dive into
the water below! Go on, I'm on the edge
of my seat!"
14,talk08,他に質問は？,Do you have a question for me?
15,talk09,"貴殿も旅の者なら
一度や二度水場に飛び込んだ事はあるだろう？
それを小生に見せてくれまいか？

飛び込むときは頭から水面へ
つま先まで真っ直ぐに…お願いだ","As a traveler, I am sure you must have
tried diving at least once or twice, yes?

Would you mind showing me? Please?


When you dive, do so headfirst.
Break the water's surface straight
on down to the tips of your toes!"
16,talk10,"貴殿は物を見たり聞いたりした時
感動して心が震えた事は無いか？
小生はそれを「飛び込む姿」に
感じてしまったのだ
人が水と一体となる直前の あの姿…
あれこそが究極の美ではないか…と","Have you ever seen something that made
your heart flutter with emotion? For me,
seeing a person's diving form does that.
The sight of a diver just before they
become one with the water... I believe
that to be the ultimate form of beauty."
17,talk11,"眩しい…

眩しいくらいの美しさだ…

では滝を登って""戻って来てくれ！","Blinding brightness!


Radiant beauty!


*ahem* OK, now climb the waterfall and
then meet me back here!"
18,talk12,"ファンタスティック！

感じる…！
小生の魂が雨に濡れた子犬の様に震えておる！
いいものを見せてもらった ありがとう！
さぁ小生の元へ！","Fantastic!


Can you feel that?! My soul is on fire!
It's pulsating with beauty!

You showed me something truly special!
Thank you so much! Now then,
come over here real quick!"
19,talk13,"すばらしかった！

貴殿の飛び込みと滝登り しかと見届けた！
小生は今感動の涙が溢れて止まらん！","That was amazing!


I saw your dive and waterfall climb with
my own lucky eyes! And now those very
eyes are flooded with tears of joy!"
20,talk14,…そうだ礼を渡さねばな,Yes! I must thank you somehow!
21,talk15,"…と思ったのだが貴殿は
ゴーゴーハスの実を5個""受け取れないようだ
持ち物を軽くしてから また来てくれ","I'd like to give you something as
thanks, but it seems you do not have
room for my five fleet-lotus seeds.
Please lighten your load, and then come
back to speak with me again."
22,talk16,"いやぁ感動した！

貴殿のような美しい飛び込みは
なかなか見られるものでは ないからな！
それでは今後の活躍期待しているぞ！","Oh! I feel emotionally ravaged after that!


It's not every day I get to see a diving
form as beautiful as yours, you know!

I'll be looking forward to your next dive!
I really will!"
23,talk17,"あれ？貴殿は滝登りもせず
どうやってここに戻って来たのだ？","Huh? How did you get back here without
climbing the waterfall?"
24,talk18,"できれば下の池から滝を登る所も
見せてくれまいか
ゾーラの鎧があれば簡単であろう","If you don't mind, I'd love for you to
show me how you climb a waterfall
from the water below.
If you have the Zora armor, it should be
fairly easy!"
