Young one, you should know the roads
are dangerous at night. Be careful."
14,Talk03,"まぁまぁ この雨の中笠も持たずに…
私のを貸してあげたいところだけど
この笠は シーカー族の者しか
身に着けることを許されてなくてねぇ
風邪ひかないようにねぇ","Look at you, out in the rain with no
umbrella! I'd lend you mine, but it's
actually a special umbrella...
Only members of the Sheikah tribe are
permitted to use it. Sorry... Please mind
you don't catch a cold, OK?"
15,Talk04,"はいはい
生きてますよ…
あら… 
てっきり ナーキンじいさんかと…
私は寝息が静かな性質でねぇ
時々じいさんが心配して起こしてくるものでねぇ
まったく…男ってのは
なんでこう心配性なのかねぇ…","Yeah, yeah. I'm still alive.
It's fine—don't worry...

Huh? Oh! Sorry, I thought you were my
old Olkin.

My breath is so shallow when I sleep,
sometimes my Olkin gets worried and
wakes me up.
I don't know what it is about men.
Constantly worrying..."
16,Talk05,"ここだけの話 ナーキンじいさんは
ゴスティンさんが嫌いなんじゃなく
単に ニンジンが苦手なだけなんじゃ…

まったく…男っていうのは
なんでこう見栄っ張りなのかねぇ…","Just between you and me, it's not that
my old Olkin really hates Steen...
he just can't stand carrots!
I don't get what it is about men.
So petty..."
17,Talk06,"おや お兄さん
なんだか お疲れのようだねぇ…
もう暗いし お兄さんも休んだらどうかねぇ？
宿屋は坂の下だよ空いてるといいねぇ","Young one! You look tired...
It's dark anyhow, so why not
have a rest?
The inn's at the bottom of the hill.
Hopefully they've got a vacancy."
18,Talk07,"こら！
何しとるか！",HEY! What are you doing?!
19,Talk08,"この梅の木はなぁ…

いわば私の分身みたいなもんじゃ

この木が朽ちて消える時…
私の命も…
そう思って
大切に大切に育てておるでねぇ…
なもんで私がいる限り
うちの梅園では悪さはさせないよ！","These plum trees... I've been raising
them my whole life. They've grown as
I've grown. They're...a part of me.
When these trees eventually rot and
fall away...so will I.

That's why I've painstakingly raised them
with all the love I can muster.

So as long as I'm around, there's no way
I'll let you mess with my plum garden!"
20,Talk09,"なあ おまえさん…

入っちゃいかんと言うとるだろうに！

梅の木に もしものことがあって
私の身に災いが降りかかったら どうする！
まったく…
か弱いばあさんを怒らせるんじゃないよ！","Like I said...


You are NOT allowed in here!


What if something happens to my
plum trees? What if something
happens to ME?!
For goodness' sake... Just leave a poor
old lady alone!"
