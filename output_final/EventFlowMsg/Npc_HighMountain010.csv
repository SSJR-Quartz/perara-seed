67,talk22,"やぁ！しばらくぶりだね！
",Hey! It's been a while!
68,talk23,"ほら ボク ペーダだよ！

リトの村から来る途中変なヤツに
何回か絡まれたけど何とか来れたよ！
しかし…イチカラ村は いいよねぇ～
お母さんも いないし…
何より自分で好きなものを
仕入れて売るってのが楽しくってさ！
そんなわけで よろず屋オープンしたんで
バリバリ買ってってよね！","Remember me? Fyson?


After I left Rito Village, some bandits 
tried to mug me. Lucky for me, they
didn't have wings!
Tarrey Town is really great!
Nice weather. No moms to annoy me...

It's really great being able to run my own
shop and sell the things I want to sell!

Anyway, I'm open for business, so shop
to your heart's content!"
69,talk24,またね！,See ya around!
70,talk25,お買い上げ ありがとうございま～す！,Thanks for your business!

a stranger. Come visit me at my new
home sometime!"
78,talk34,イチカラ村？なになに？詳しくおしえてよ,"Tarrey Town?
Tell me more."
79,talk35,"へぇ～…
よろず屋を募集してるんだね
でもアッカレ地方かぁ…ちょっと遠いな…

まぁ店を持てるなら どこだっていいか…","Oh! So they're in need of a general
store. That's perfect!

But the Akkala region?
That's pretty far out there.

But I guess I've got to leave the nest someday.
And to have my own store..."
80,talk39,"お店って思ってるより難しいよね～
お母さん尊敬しちゃうよ","Running a shop is harder than I thought.
I don't know how Mom does it."
81,talk40,"もうすぐアレだろう？

エノキダさんとパウダさんの
結婚式があるんだろう？","Hey, you know what's coming up?


Hudson and Rhondson's wedding!"
82,talk41,"おめでたいよね～

これを機会にイチカラ村に
いっぱい人が集まるといいなぁ～","I'm really happy for them.
Plus it's really good for business.

I hope a lot of people come to
Tarrey Town for the occasion. "
83,talk42,"え！知らないのかい？

直接本人に聞いてみなよ！","What?! You didn't know?


You're out of the loop, man!"
84,talk43,"売ったり仕入れたりは大変だけど
自由に物を売れるから楽しくってさ！","Supply and demand is a lot tougher than
I thought, but it's fun getting to choose
what I sell!"
85,talk44,"いい結婚式だったね！

エノキダさんはマジメだし
パウダさんは美人だしお似合いだよね！
ボクの お父さんとお母さんも
昔は あんな感じだったのかなぁ？","What an awesome wedding!


Hudson is a stand-up guy, and Rhondson
is a real gem. They're perfect for each
other!
I wonder if my mom and pop were like
that back in the day."
86,talk45,"そう言えば エノキダさんが
キミに話があるっぽかったよ？
エノキダさんなら パウダさんのトコに居るし
行ってみたら？","By the way, did you hear that Hudson
wanted to talk to you?

He's at Rhondson's place.
You should stop by."
87,talk46,"結婚式も終わってやれやれだね！

パウダさん綺麗だったよね～

ボクもいつかは あんなお嫁さんを…
ウフフフ！
さ おしゃべりはこの辺にして
今日も張り切って よろず屋をやらせてもらうよ","So glad the wedding went well!


Rhondson looked stunning...


I hope I'll be able to find a bride as
pretty as her someday... Hehehe!

Well, I should get back to the shop.
Responsibility and all that."
88,talk47,"調子はどう？
ボクはいつも通りだよ！
そう言えばキミって旅の人なんだよね？

必要な物があれば
ボクの所で揃えていってよね！","How's it going? I'm great as always!


Hey, so... You're an adventurer, right?
That probably means you need to carry
a lot of supplies with you at all times.
Well, if there's anything you need,
come get it at my shop!"
89,talk48,"いくらお客さんでも
そこに乗られると困るよぉ～","I don't care if you are a paying customer,
I can't let you climb up there."
90,talk49,頼むから そこから下りてぇ～…,"Please, get down from there..."
91,talk50,"商品の陳列棚には
乗らないでくれるかなぁ～","Can I ask you to not stand on the
shelves, please? Those are expensive."
92,talk51,他のお客さんの迷惑になるから下りてぇ～,"This is a place of business, not a gym.
Please get down."
