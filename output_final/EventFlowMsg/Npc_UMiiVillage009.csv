14,talk01,フン…,Hmpf...
15,talk02,"細かい事は気にしない
じゃあ はい","I don't care about the details.
Here, take it."
16,talk03,"下賤な庶民と口を利く暇なぞ無いんですが…
まあいいでしょう
チミ…そんな身なりだから
きっとお金に困っているでしょう？","I normally don't have time to mingle with
commoners...but I have a feeling about
you. I'll make an exception this time.
Your clothes...
I'm guessing you're a little hard up for
cash. Am I right?"
17,talk04,正直でよろしい,I appreciate your honesty.
18,talk05,"じゃ前金で
100ルピー差し上げましょう","So for the down payment...
I'd say 100 rupees sounds fair, yes?"
19,talk06,"ホーッ ホッホ！
受け取りましたね！
それじゃ私の言う事を聞いてください","Hoh ho ho!
So you accept, then? Excellent!

Now, listen to what I have to say."
20,talk07,"この村の西に広がるターリン湿地…
あそこってガーディアンが居るんでしょう？
しかも2体も！

アレってアレでしょう？
1体でも充分 お強いんでしょう？
だからチミ…ターリン湿地で歩いている
ガーディアンを2体とも ぶっ倒してください","The Torin Wetland lies to the west of
here. You're aware that there are
Guardians there? Not just one, either...
Two of them!!


You know how dangerous they are...


So, sonny boy... I'd like you to find and
wallop both of them in Torin Wetland.
Then come and see me."
21,talk09,お手,Hand!
22,talk10,だから言ったじゃないですか…,Didn't I tell you...
23,talk11,"庶民とのコミュニケーションも
セレブの務め… か
私は ハギ
「泣く子も黙る剛腕ハギ」とは私の事ですよ
私は…全てを手に入れてしまってね

最近は命のやり取りを見るくらいしか
楽しみが無いんですよ
空しい…全てが…","I suppose I must endure engaging with the
common folk if I hope to get something done...

You've no doubt heard of the ferocious
Hagie? That's me. But I...got everything
I wanted.
Lately my days have felt so empty.
The only things that thrill me now are
true risks to life and limb.
Everything else just feels...hollow."
24,talk12,"100ルピー欲しいのでしょう？
じゃ はい","I'm sorry? You don't want the 100
rupees? All right, then."
25,talk13,ん～…弱りました…,Hmm... And you are...
26,talk15,まだ私に用ですか？,Do you need something else from me?
27,talk16,チミか…,It's you...
28,talk17,"…嘘ついてもダメですよ

これだから庶民は…","...If you think you can put one over on
me, I have grave news for you, sonny.

Just the sort of shoddy, corner-cutting job I expect
from the common rabble..."
29,talk19,"分かったらターリン湿地を歩いている
ガーディアンを2体！倒して来てください","If you're clear on the deal, then go take
out the two Guardians walking around
Torin Wetland."
30,talk20,"はいはい分かってます

あなたはターリン湿地の歩いている
ガーディアンを 2体倒しました！
…これでいいんでしょう？

約束通り残りの褒美を取らせます
はい じゃぁ
お手","OK. OK. I saw the whole thing.
You did splendidly. I'll give you the
rest of the reward, as I promised."
31,talk21,"なんですか その不満そうな顔は…

前金の方が多いじゃないかって？

これだから庶民は…

その「前金＝少額」という固定概念こそが
庶民の発想なのですよ
とにかくチミは用済みです
あっち行ってください","Why do you look so disappointed?
It can't be because the reward is lower
than the down payment, can it?
You commoners with your notions and
assumptions...

The whole idea that a down payment is a
small part of the final payment is an idea
entirely unique to the common folk!
In any case, our business is concluded.
Go over there. Or anywhere, really.
Anywhere that isn't. Right. Here."
32,talk22,"私は…全てを手に入れた

しかしお金では どうしても
手に入らない物も あるんですよ…","I...got everything I wanted.


But I'll tell you, there are some things
out there... Things that all the money in
the world can't get you..."
33,talk23,はぁ…弱ったな…,Haaah... I've grown weak...
34,talk24,"娘の体調がよくなったって事は
この別荘は もう要らない…？ うーむ…","My daughter's health has improved...

anymore? Hmmm..."
35,talk26,"さて今日も家族と日向ぼっこですよ
邪魔なんで あっち行きなさい","I'm going sunbathing with my family.
You're in my way—cease to be so."
36,talk27,はぁ…私はどうすれば…,Haah... What can I do...
37,talk28,"いい夕焼けです…
心が洗われるようです","What a beautiful sunset...
My soul feels cleansed."
38,talk29,"今日も一日
いい日向ぼっこができました…っと",I'm so glad I was able to sunbathe today.
