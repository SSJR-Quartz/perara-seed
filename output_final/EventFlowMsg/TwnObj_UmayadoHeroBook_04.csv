8,Book01,"昨日遠き地の友 ハイラル王国の王妃が
ゲルドの街にやって来た
授かった赤子を早く見せに来たかったらしい

名前は ゼルダ
時折り浮かべる笑顔が とても可愛らしい子だ
王妃に似て美人に育つだろう… そう伝えると
器量より幸せに恵まれて欲しいと彼女は言った
娘を見つめるその姿は とても幸せそうだった","My dear friend from afar came to visit
Gerudo Town today. It is always a
pleasure to see the queen of Hyrule.
She described her reason for coming
as urgent. She wished for me to meet
her newborn child.
Her sweet daughter's name is Zelda.
She has her mother's smile. I cannot
help but cherish her already.
I told her that Zelda is sure to grow up
into a dignified and beautiful queen,
just like her mother.
My friend thanked me, but said that looks
are fleeting, and instead she wishes for
Zelda to be blessed with true happiness.
The way she gazes upon her daughter...
her little bird, as she calls her...I have
never seen such unconditional love."
9,Book02,"王妃の葬儀に参列してから少し経って
ようやく これを書く気になった
突然のことで いまだに信じられない
彼女との想い出が蘇り いまも涙をこらえている
葬儀の間 まだ幼いゼルダは毅然と前を向き
亡くなった母を送り出していた
その姿は とても立派だったが…
彼女の頑張り過ぎが心配になった","It has been a long while since we laid
my dear friend, the queen, to rest.
I only now have the will to write again.
It was so sudden. I still can't believe
she is gone.

All of my sweet memories of her keep
running through my mind. Even now,
I can hardly keep the tears at bay.
Young Zelda kept her head held high
as she said her final good-bye to her
mother at the funeral.
She carried herself as a true princess,
but I can sense the deep grief she is
hiding within. I worry for her..."
10,Book03,"ハイラル王国へ表敬に赴く
王との謁見の後 1年振りにゼルダと会った
泉に修行に行く と言う彼女が気になり
王の許可を得て同行する事にした
彼女は耐えがたい寒さの中日が落ちても
ずっと泉の中で祈りの行を続けた…
何度も やめるように告げたが聞く耳を持たない
彼女を水の中から無理やり引きずり出した
弱々しい表情で私を見上げた彼女は
課せられた任が果たせない焦りを口にした
歴代の姫がしてきた事が どうしても出来ない…
そう呟くゼルダを思わず抱きしめていた","I made a voyage to visit Hyrule.
After speaking with the king, I saw
Zelda for the first time in a year.
In truth, it was my concern for her
that brought me there.

The king allowed me to keep her
company as she went to the spring
for her training.
There, Zelda prayed and prayed in the
spring's icy waters until the sun set.

I told her many times to stop, but she
wouldn't listen. I eventually had to
drag her out of the water.
Zelda gazed at me for the longest time
with heartbreaking vulnerability.

Eventually, in a tiny voice, she told me
of the pressure and panic she feels at
not being able to fulfill her sacred duty.
She whispered over and over, \""Why can I
not do as the royal daughters of the past
have done? What is wrong with me?\"" 
All I could do was hold her close
and listen... I pray that it is enough."
11,Book04,"今日 ハイラル王国からの使者が訪れた
私に神獣の繰り手となる事を頼みたいそうだ
族長が このような危険な役目を… と
危ぶむ者もいるが この依頼受けるつもりだ
厄災の復活はハイラル王国だけではなく世界に
関わる問題であり我がゲルドとの関わりも深い
もうすぐ ゼルダが正式な回答を求め
ここを訪れるという…
彼女に逢うのが楽しみだ","Emissaries from Hyrule came to see me
today. They informed me that I have been
chosen to pilot the Divine Beast.
My people are uneasy about it. They tell
me such a dangerous task is not fitting
for the chief. I understand their fear.
However, I intend to accept this task.


Calamity Ganon's resurrection does not
only threaten Hyrule, but the whole
world. I refuse to sit idly by.
Ganon is also closely associated
with the Gerudo...an association
I deeply resent.
I believe Zelda will be here soon to
receive my official answer. I am excited
to see her, as always."
12,Book05,"ハイラル城での叙任式に参加…
運命を共にする仲間達と英傑に任ぜられた
ゼルダ リーバル ミファー そして リンクは
次の時代を築く若者達だ
私とダルケルは彼らを支えていこうと思う…
だが少し気になる事もあった
ゼルダのリンクへの態度…
理由は想像出来る
リンクは ゼルダの護衛役にも選ばれたそうだし
仲良くやってくれれば良いが…","I attended the inauguration ceremony
alongside the other Champions whom
I share a fate with.
Zelda, Revali, Mipha, and Link are so
young. They are Hyrule's future. Daruk
and I hope to help them see that future.
However, one thing did trouble me.
Zelda was...uncharacteristically cold
toward Link. I can imagine why.
I hear Link has been assigned as Zelda's
guardian knight. I hope they find a way
to get along."
13,Book06,"今日 リンクが会いに来た…男子禁制の掟を
利用したゼルダに撒かれたと言う
私が知恵を授けてやり街に入る事は出来たが
ゼルダは見つからなかった
彼女がここに来たら連絡する約束をして
一旦引き揚げさせた
彼も ゼルダとは違う意味で不器用な処が有る
ある意味では似合いの二人だ","Link requested to meet with me today.


He tells me Zelda exploited our law
that restricts men from entering town
to slip away from him.
I told him of a trick that would allow him
entrance, and he was able to get in.
By then, however, Zelda was long gone.
I promised to let him know if I saw her,
so he reluctantly returned home.

In a similar yet distinct way, Link seems
to have trouble expressing himself.

Perhaps the two can help each other...
That is, if she ever gives him the chance."
14,Book07,"今日は ゼルダと共にナボリスで遺物調査へ…
疲れた彼女は陽が落ちると眠ってしまった
リンクに連絡を取ると彼は驚くほど早く
ナボリスに現れた
余計な世話かも知れないが私にしてやれる事は
これ位だと思い ゼルダの事をリンクに話した
後は二人が自分達で何とかしていくしか
無いだろう","Today I accompanied Zelda as she went
to research Naboris. When the sun set,
the poor, exhausted girl drifted to sleep.
I sent word to Link, who showed up
at Naboris faster than I expected.

Although it is none of my business, I felt
the least I could do to bridge their gap
was to share some things about Zelda.
The rest is up to them."
15,Book08,"最近 ゼルダはよく笑うようになった
リンクとの仲も良くなってきた様子だ
これが あの子の修行に良い影響を
与えてくれると いいのだが…
しかし果たして間に合うだろうか
各地で異変や魔物の出現が増えていると聞く
ゼルダに…御ひい様に時間を与えてくれと…
私は祈ることにしよう
神にではなく
あの子の母…私の友に","I am so happy to say that Zelda smiles
much more often lately. It seems she and
Link have finally learned to get along.
I hope this will have a positive effect on
her training. However...I am concerned
we may be running out of time.
Whenever I hear of monster attacks
or other unusual events plaguing
the kingdom, my concern grows.
All I can do is pray that Zelda...
my little bird...has enough time.

I do not pray to the goddesses, but to
her mother. My dearest friend...
How I miss her."
