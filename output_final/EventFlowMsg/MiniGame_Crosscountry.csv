1,"""0002""",勝負する,You're on.
2,0002_00,"ヘーィ！""イイネ！イイヨ！サイコーだよ！
ただしかけっこといえど勝負は勝負！
20ルピーを賭けてもらう！
俺とかけっこ勝負するかい？","Yahoo! Now we're talking! This is
fantastic! But every challenge has to
have some stakes.
I'll bet you 20 rupees I can beat you in
a race. You have to pay first, though!"
3,0002_01,"ヘーィ！""イイネ！イイヨ！サイコーだよ！
また20ルピーを賭けて俺とかけっこ勝負だ","Yahoo! Now we're talking! This is
fantastic! Why don't you put down
another 20 rupees and race me again?"
4,"""0004""",勝負しない,I don't feel like it.
5,0004_00,"オット！残念！

久しぶりに見込みのある青年と
出会えたと思ったのに…見込み違いか…ヘェーィ","Noooo! What a letdown... I thought I'd
finally met a tough boy with some real
potential. Guess I thought wrong."
6,"""0005""",もちろん勝負する,Let's get started.
7,0005_00,"ヘィ！""その意気込みこそが大事だな！
じゃあ準備するし ちょっと待っててくれ！","Yesss! Now you're getting into the
spirit of things! I'll go set things up.
Don't go anywhere!"
8,0005_01,"ヘィ！""お待たせ！足の先まで準備万端だ！
お待ちかねのかけっこ勝負の時間だぜ！ヘィ！","OK! Thanks for waiting! I'm so ready
I could burst, and I bet you are too!
So let's begin...the race!"
9,0005_03,"かけっこのゴールはあの山のてっぺんの旗の所！
どちらかがゴールに着いた時点で勝負は終了！","The goal is the flags on top of the 
mountain! There's only two of us, so the
race ends once someone reaches them!"
10,0005_04,"ヘイ！わかっているとは思うが…
かけっこ勝負は自分の力だけでの勝負だ！
馬を使ったり ゴールを目指さなかったり
した場合は失格になるから気を付けてくれよ！","One more thing! You could probably
guess this already, but this is a foot race,
not a hoof race.
If you ride your horse or run away from
the goal instead of toward it, you'll
be disqualified!"
11,0005_07,"ヘィ！""かけっこ勝負！ ヨーイ…",And now...it's time! Get ready...
12,0005_08,ドン！,Go!
13,0005_NotEnoughMoney,"ヘィ！軍資金として20ルピーを用意してから
かけっこ勝負といこうじゃないか！まってるぜ！","Oops! I don't race without those 20
rupees on the line. Why don't you go
get some so we can finally race?
I'll be waiting!"
14,"""0006""",じゃあ勝負しない,You lost me.
15,0006_00,"ヘィ！""戦う前から諦めか？
そんな心構えで この先旅を続けられるのか？","What?! You're giving up before we
even start? Yikes... You'll never get
anywhere in life with that attitude!"
16,0009_01,"ヘィ！またかけっこで勝負をしたくなったら
俺はいつでも挑戦を受けて立つぜ！ヘイヘーイ！","Whew! If you ever want to go again,
I'd jump at the chance! See you around!"
17,"""0010""",じゃあ続ける,Then I'll continue.
18,"""0014""",勝負する,One more time!
19,0014_00,"ヘーイ！""イイネ！イイヨ！サイコーネ！
ルールはさっきと一緒早くゴールした方の勝ち","Woooo-hooo! I love this guy! 
All right!

Same rules as before. Whoever reaches
the goal first wins!"
20,0014_NotEnoughMoney,"ヘィ！""かけっこ勝負するなら
軍資金の20ルピーを用意してくれ！","Whoops! You need 20 rupees if you
wanna race!"
21,"""0015""",勝負しない,I've had enough.
22,0015_00,ヘィ！そりゃ残念だぜ… ヘーィ…,Aww. That's...not the answer I hoped for...
23,0015_01,ヘィ！旅で素足を鍛えるんだぜ！,"Use all that traveling you do as a
chance to build up your leg muscles!"
24,AtGoal_00,"ヘィ！ゴォォォォール！俺の勝ちー！
ニイチャン俺に挑むには まだ100年早いな？","Wheeee! I did it! I won! You gotta
give those flat feet some exercise if you
ever wanna beat me, friend!"
25,AtGoal_00_00,"ヘーィ！""ニイチャン もうゴールしたのか？
うーん…今回は俺の負けだ！…ヘイヘーイ…","Done! Wait... You're done too?
You were done...first? Hrm...
That means I lose..."
26,AtGoal_01_03,"ニイチャンのタイムは分秒俺も本気じゃなかったとはいえ…勝負は勝負！
これかけっこ勝負の報酬！受け取ってくれ！","Your time was ...I wasn't REALLY trying my best...but a 
bet is a bet! Here's your reward for a
race well run!"
27,AtGoal_01_04,"ヘィ！俺のタイムは分秒ニイチャンも まあまあ頑張ったとは思うが
俺に勝つつもりなら もっと鍛えないとな！","Nice! My time was ...You did OK, but if you're ever gonna beat
me, you've gotta try harder than that!"
28,AtGoal_02,ヘィ！もう一勝負していかないか？,Whew! So...wanna race again? 
29,Halt_00,"ヘィヘィヘィ！
かけっこは自分の足で走る勝負だ！ 
馬はダメでしょ！""失格！…ヘーイ…","Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is a foot
race, not a hoof race! No horses
allowed! Hey... That means I win by default!"
30,Halt_01,"ヘーィ！""俺の説明が足りなかったかな？
かけっこ勝負は自分の足でゴールを目指す勝負！
つまり ゴールを目指すルートを大きく外れたり
馬に乗っての移動は失格ということでよろしく！","One more time! Maybe I wasn't clear
enough before, but a race is all about
reaching the goal on your own two feet!
In other words, running the wrong way
or getting on your horse means you're
disqualified!"
31,Halt_02,"ヘィヘィヘィ！""どこに行くつもりだー？
ゴールに向かってくれないと勝負にならないぞ！
ゴールに向かってくれないとなぁ…失格です！
戻ってきてくれ！勝負の確認をしよう！","What the heck?! Where do you think 
you're going? If you're not racing
toward the goal, you're just running!
And that doesn't do anyone any good...
The race is off! Why don't you come back
so I can explain the rules again?"
32,Initial_00,"ヘィ！ニイチャン！体力に自信があるなら
いっちょ俺とかけっこで勝負してみないか？","Hey, friend! You look like a tough boy.
But how tough are you? Tough enough
to challenge me to a race?"
33,Initial_01,"ヘィ！立派なお馬さんでの旅もいいが…
自分の足での旅！それも大事だと思わないか？","Hey, friend! Sure, horses are
convenient and fast, but what about
standing on your own two feet?
Don't you think it's important to exercise
your legs too?"
34,Initial_02,"ヘィ！""俺は自分の足で勝負したいんだ！
悪いが馬から降りて話しかけてくれ！","I'm itching to challenge you to
a foot race, but you need to get off
your high horse first! Please? For me?"
