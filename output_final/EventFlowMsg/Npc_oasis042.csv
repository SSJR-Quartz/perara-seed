ここは兵舎だぞ！
今 ここは厳戒態勢中なんだ
観光なら市場にでも行くんだな","What are you doing here, outsider?!
This is the barracks for Gerudo soldiers!

We're on high alert right now. If you
want to do some sightseeing, go
check out the market instead!"

それは雷鳴の兜ではないか！
なぜお前が被っているんだ！！
私など触れるどころか
近付く事さえ ままならなかったというのに…
うう…
こいつらさえ私の足を引っ張らなければ
お前の代わりに私が賊を倒し
族長様のお供をしたものを…
とはいえ こいつらとも
もう長い付き合いでな
出来の悪いヤツほど
かわいく見えてくるんだよなぁ
でもなぁ… こいつらがいる限りは
やっぱり出世は見込めないだろうなぁ…","Whoa! Isn't that the Thunder Helm?!
I thought that was only for the chief...

Hrmph... If it weren't for the others, I
would have been the one to track down
the thieves and hang out with the chief.
Although... I've been working with
everyone for quite a while, and I only
just realized...
The worse I am at my job, the more the
others will take care of me. And I kind of
like that.
But that doesn't make me look all that
good, so I can kiss any hope of a
promotion sav'orq while they're around."

国家の機密事項だぞ！

チーク隊長からの
許可でもでれば別だけどな","Well, you see...


Wait, why would I tell an outsider like
you about important matters involving
the security of our people?!
If you had permission from Captain
Teake, that'd be a different story..."
14,talk02,"さっきの褒美で
街を楽しんでくるといいぞ","You should use your reward from earlier
and enjoy what our town has to offer."
15,talk03,"お前…
なかなか見どころがあるな","I may have dismissed you too hastily
before. You have many promising
qualities..."

我々は まだ油断はできない
引き続き
警備を怠らんようにしないとな","Barta let me know how helpful you've
been.

However... Despite the thieves having
been defeated, we can't afford to let our
guard down, even for a moment.
We've got to make sure that something
like that theft never, ever happens again!"
17,talk05,"わかったなら
さっさとここから離れるんだな","If you understood, then hurry on up
and get a move on!"
