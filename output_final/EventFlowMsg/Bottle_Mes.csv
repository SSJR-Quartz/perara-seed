アナタも水の妖精へ お願いに？
…違うわねだってボトルを持っていないもの

ひょっとして アナタって…
水の妖精の使者？","Hm? Do you have a wish for the water
fairy too?

Oh... I suppose not. If you did,
you'd have a letter to send.

But wait, does that mean you're...
a servant of the water fairy?!"
20,talk02,"だったら お願いがあるんです！

今から流すメッセージボトルを追いかけて
ボトルを手にした人に会ってきて欲しいんです
そして彼がどんな人か
私に教えて欲しい…","OH, WOW! If that's the case, I have an
important request for you!

Once I release it, I'd like you to follow
my love letter and get to know whoever
picks it up.
Once you do that, please report back to
me so I can find out what kind of person
he is..."
21,talk03,"…今 「自分で行けば？」って
思いましたよね？
私 お母さんに「ここより遠くに行っちゃダメ」
って言われてるんです…
だから お願い
ボトルの受取人を… ね？
くぷぷ…ありがとうございますっ","I know, I know. You're probably thinking,
\""Why not just go yourself, lazy girl?!\""
I'm right, aren't I?
The thing is, I promised my mother
I wouldn't venture out too far.

So I'm begging you. Please... Find the
person who picks up this letter. OK?

Tee hee! Thank you!"
22,talk04,"それじゃ ボトルを投げますよ？
準備はいいですか？","Excellent! OK, I'm going to throw the
letter in now! Are you ready?"
23,talk05,"待ちますけど…
早くしてくださいね","Oh. Sure, I can wait...
But please make it quick!"
24,talk06,"ボトルは壊れやすいから
気をつけてくださいね","These letter containers break easily,
so please be careful."
25,talk07,あら アナタは…,"Oh, you..."
26,talk08,"そんな訳ないでしょう…
子供だからって からかわないでください","That can't possibly be so... Please don't
make fun of me just because I'm a
cute girl."
27,talk09,でも旅の人なら ラッキー！,"If you're a traveler, that's lucky for me!"
28,talk10,えっ何ですか？,Hm? What is it?
29,talk100,おはようございます,Good morning.
30,talk101,こんにちは,Hello.
31,talk102,こんばんは,Good evening.
32,talk103,やぁ,Hey!
33,talk104,"突然だけど キミはゾーラの里に
行った事は あるかい？","Sorry for the random question, but have
you ever been to Zora's Domain?"
34,talk105,そうか…ここから遠い？,I see... Is it far from here?
35,talk106,"そうか…

あぁ…ごめんごめん
自己紹介を忘れてたよ
僕はササノ旅の行商人さ

ゾーラの里に行くところだったんだけど
入り江にメッセージボトルが引っ掛かっててね
差出人は ゾーラの女性の
フィネさんって人だったんだ
そこで僕の返事はゾーラの里に行く旅人に預けて
手紙のやり取りをしていたんだよ","I see...


Oh! Sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.


I am Sasan, the traveling merchant.


I was on my way to Zora's Domain...
but a love letter in this inlet caught
my eye.
The writer seems to be a lovely Zora
named Finley.

I've been corresponding with her by
giving my replies to travelers heading
to Zora's Domain."
36,talk107,"ゾーラの女性からの手紙…
気になるかい？","A mysterious letter from a Zora woman...
Intriguing, is it not?"
37,talk108,"残念ながら
内容を教えてあげる事は できないな
僕は女性からの手紙を他の人に教えるような
無粋な事は しない主義でね
でも言葉づかいは丁寧だし
きっと上品な大人の女性なんだろうな","Unfortunately, I can't tell you what she
wrote. A gentleman would never read
a lady's letter to a stranger.
But I CAN assure you that she writes in
the sweetest, most refined way ever.
She must be a very elegant young lady.
Actually, as a Zora, she's probably a lot
older than me. That doesn't bother me
one bit, but...I hope she feels the same."
38,talk109,そうかならいいんだ,I see... Very well then.
39,talk11,"はい… それでは引き続き
ボトルを壊さないように追いかけてくださいね","Right... As I was saying: please follow
that letter. And don't let it break!"
40,talk111,"さて…次は彼女の手紙が来る番だから
僕はもう少し ここで待つとするよ","So then... Next it's her turn to write,
so I'll just wait here awhile."
41,talk113,"君は…このメッセージボトルを
追ってきたのかい？",So...you were following this letter?
42,talk114,"おおかた彼女に「どんな人か見て来て欲しい」
とか…言われたんじゃないかな？
以前僕が「筋肉ムキムキの冒険者さ」って嘘を
書いたらそれ以降彼女が会いたがっちゃって…
だから会いに行きたくても
どうにも腰が重くてね…
しまったなぁ
こうなるなら嘘書くんじゃなかったよ…","Hm, so she asked you to come down
here and see what kind of person I am.
Is that it?
Well, earlier I lied when I wrote to her
that I was a buff traveler. She said she
wanted to meet me, but...
Even though I'm dying to meet her,
I can't do it.

I've really blown it. If I had known this
would happen—that I'd fall for her—
I never would've lied..."
43,talk115,"心が大事…か
うん そう言ってくれると助かるよ","Love reigns supreme... Hmm. I suppose
it does. Ya know, hearing that does make
me feel a little better."
44,talk116,"確かに…
もうこれは筋トレを頑張るしかないよね…","This could work... I guess I just have to
start pumping up my muscles now..."
45,talk119,"あー！

せっかく書いた お手紙が…

でもいいですよ
わざとじゃないと思いますし 
文章もイマイチだったから
また書き直そっと…","Ahhh!!


I worked really hard on that letter...


But it's OK... It's not like you did it
on purpose or anything.

I bet I could be even more eloquent than
that anyway, so I'll just start over and
write a new letter... "
46,talk12,"女の子の間では この願いの川辺から
メッセージボトルを流して
返事が来たら幸せになれる
という言い伝えがあるんです
そしてついに私にも返事があったんです！

どんな人か確かめたくなったから
会ってみたいんですけど
お母さんには遠くに行くなって言われてるから
直接会いに行くことはできなくて…
「筋肉ムキムキの冒険者だ」
って お返事には書いてあったのですが
いつも繊細な文章なので
きっと素敵な方なんだろうなって思うんです","For Zora girls, there's a superstition that
if you send a love letter from the
Bank of Wishes and get a response...
You'll have good fortune for life!
Who doesn't want that?!

And after many attempts...
I finally got a response!

Of course, I'm no chump and certainly
no fool. I wasn't hatched yesterday!

I need to know what kind of person my
mystery man is. That's why I desperately
want to meet him.
Thing is, my mom told me not to venture
too far, and I agree going on my own is
a dumb idea. I'm not sure what to do.
Hmmm... He described himself as,
\""a buff and super gorgeous traveler.\""
Gosh, I hope THAT'S the truth.
And with that delicate penmanship,
I suspect he's quite refined.
Regal, even!
If he's a Hylian, I do hope he's OK with
being with a Zora who's considerably
older than him. Wiser too, no doubt.
Hey, love requires an open mind,
wouldn't you say?"
47,talk121,"あー！

せっかく書いた お手紙がー！
また書き直さなきゃ
でもいいわ 

ちょっとした試練がある方が
恋も燃え上がるというものよ！ くぷぷ","AHHH!!


I worked SO hard on that letter! And now
I have to write ANOTHER one?

*sigh* Oh, well. 


After all, they say the more you have
to struggle for love, the sweeter it is.
Hee hee, yeah... That must be true."
48,talk122,"よ～し…ここは当たって砕けろで
彼女に会ってみようかな…
そういえば大雨は止んだんだっけ？手紙に 「ゾーラの里で待ってる」って
書いてたから…
トレーニングを兼ねて
里まで走って行ってみるよ！
それじゃあ
ゾーラの里で また会おう！","OK! It's time for me to take a chance
and try to meet her...

Oh, that reminds me... I wonder if the
torrential rain has stopped.She's waiting in Zora's Domain.
That's what her letter says, anyway.

So I'll achieve two goals at the same
time and train up my muscles on
the way there! I'll get super beefy!
Yeah, that's the ticket! I'll run all the way
to the domain! Catch ya later!

We'll meet again at Zora's Domain—
I'm sure of it!"
49,talk123,"あら！アナタは…！

ねえササノ君！
お手紙のことを見届けてくれたのはこの人なの","Oh! It's you!


Hey, Sasan! This is the guy who made
sure my letter reached you safely!"
50,talk124,"おお君は！
あれからなんとかゾーラの里に着いたよ
おかげで フィネさんに会うくらいの
勇気と根性はついた…気がするよ","Oh! It's you! As you can see, I somehow
made it to Zora's Domain.

Thanks to you, I managed to work up the
courage to finally meet Finley. At least,
that's how I see it."
51,talk125,"私の運命の人と引き合わせてくれて
ありがとう！
あなたに会ったら お礼をしましょうって
ササノ君と相談していたの
これ二人から…受け取ってください！","Thank you so much for introducing me
to my soul mate!

Sasan and I discussed it, and we decided
we just HAD to thank you the next time
we saw you.
So here... This is from both of us.
Thank you for everything!"
52,talk126,"ササノ君！泳いだり ガケ登りしたりして
もっと筋肉モリモリになってね！","Sasan! Be sure to swim and climb and lift
and stuff. A LOT. That will help you build
up those muscles you promised me!"
53,talk127,"ううん…
がんばるよ……","As you wish...my darling...
I'll try my best..."
54,talk13,"私はフィネ
ゾーラの里から来ました
お父さんもお母さんも忙しくって
相手してくれないから
いつも こうして一人で遊んでるんです","I'm Finley. I came from Zora's Domain.


My mother and father are so busy,
we rarely spend time together anymore.
I spend most days in solitude."
55,talk14,メッセージボトルを見失ったんですね？,"You lost sight of my love letter,
didn't you?"
56,talk15,"分かりました
ボトルは壊れやすいので気を付けてくださいね","I understand. These containers break
really easily, so please be careful."
57,talk16,他に質問は ありますか？,Do you have any other questions?
58,talk17,"こんな事もあろうかと
予備を作っておきました","Luckily, I thought something like that
might happen, so I made an extra."
59,talk22,そうなんですか！ラッキー！,"Oh, really?! How lucky!"
