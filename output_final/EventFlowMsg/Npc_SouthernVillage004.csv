to sleep. You should get some sleep, too!"
16,talk03,"そうかい じゃあ教えてやろう
海では風にうまく乗ることが大切さ～
俺たち漁師は
長年の経験で風を読んで船を操る
でもな世間にはコログのうちわってえ
便利な道具があるらしいのさ
これを使えば 
風を自由に操れるってえ話さ～","Well then, let me tell you a bit about it...
Most importantly, the wind is critical
to getting around at sea.
Fishermen like us have learned, after
years of experience, to predict and use
the wind to control our ships.
However... I've heard there is an object
called a Korok leaf that will help you
control the wind yourself!"
17,talk04,"そうかい見かけによらないな

海に出るには長い経験が必要さ！
うかつに出れば風に流され遭難しちまうさぁ！","Huh, never would have guessed that just
from looking at ya.

Just remember...going out to sea isn't
something you should take lightly! The
wind can quickly strand you out there!"
18,talk05,"雨の日に海に出るのは
危ないのさ～！
風も強いし船を操るのは至難のわざだ！
生きては帰ってこれないぜ！","Going out to sea on a rainy day is
dangerous!

The wind is really strong, making it tough
to control your boat. There's no way to
be sure you'll even come back alive!"

この近くの海で獲れたものさぁ～
欲しかったら好きなだけ持っていくさ～
多めに焼きすぎてしまったのさぁ","Doesn't that fish look delicious? I caught
it myself, too!

You're welcome to help yourself.
I cooked way too much for just myself
alone."
20,talk09,"美味しそうな焼き魚だ
この辺の海で捕れたものだろうか","Those grilled fish look really good.
I wonder if they were caught locally..."
21,talk10,あんた魚好きなのかいさ？,Do you like fish?
22,talk11,"この辺で獲れた魚は それはそれは旨いのさ～
食べたら きっと魚が好きになるさ
好きなだけ持って行っていいから
試しに食べてみるさ～","The fish around here are really good!
All it takes is a little taste to fall in love
with the local flavor!
Take as many as you like—just give it
a try!"
23,talk12,"どうだい魚食べたかいさ？
旨かっただろう？","How about it? Did you try the fish?
Wasn't it delicious?"
24,talk13,はやく食べると いいさ～,You should hurry up and eat it!

place next door and you can, too!"
29,talk18,"雨の日は漁に出れないから
商売あがったりなのさ～","I'm a fisherman by trade. But I can't go
out fishing when it's raining, so each
raindrop cuts into my bottom line."
30,talk19,それは運しだいなのさ,"Depends on your luck, for sure."
