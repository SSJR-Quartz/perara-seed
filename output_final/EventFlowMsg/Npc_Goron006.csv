ユン坊は そのダルケル様の子孫 ってワケよォ！","...What's gotten into you? Hylians sure

で そのダルケルの護りで固くなったユン坊を
ルーダニアにぶつけて追っ払ってんだァ！
ヤツにゃ普通の大砲の弾は
効かねェからなァ…
…","That's why that slacker can even use
Daruk's Protection!

He uses it to protect himself when we
fire him at Rudania. That's the only way
we can chase that blasted beast away.
We have no choice because normal
cannonballs are no good against him."
34,talk116,"大丈夫…

ユン坊もどことなく しっかりしやがった
アンタのおかげだよ
それにしても…見てみろィ！","Hm? Hey! It's you! Yunobo told me
everything. You really are somethin'
else, brother. Ya know that?
I can't believe you conquered Rudania...
Color me impressed.

But good grief...did ya have to do it just
when my back pain went away? I was all
ready and rarin' to go at Rudania myself!
Now you've gone and made it look like
I was just fibbin' about my back pain
this whole time! Imagine that! ME!
GWA HA HA HA!


Oh! And I'm also happy to see Yunobo
finally got his act together. I know that's
your doing, as well.
But enough back patting and other
such nonsense. Take a look at this!"

挨拶に来た ってワケだなァ？！

ブルドーとは オレの事よ！","I see... So, then, you came all this
way to pay your respects to me?
I like you already, brother!
Well, my name's Bludo.


I'm the great Goron Boss who's fearsome
enough to silence a crying child! Or to
make a silenced child cry, either way.
Yes, it is none other than I, Bludo!"
43,talk39,"神獣 ヴァ・ルーダニアも
大人しくなっちまって ざまあねぇな

thank you, brother!"
47,talk45,いちちちち…,Ouch... Argh...
48,talk46,"巨岩砕きは ユン坊のご先祖様…
つまり ダルケル様が使ってたヤツだぜィ","The Boulder Breaker once belonged to

it was Daruk's."
49,talk47,もう寝るとこなんだが…,I was just about to turn in for the night...
50,talk48,"ま ダルケル様はそいつを
団扇の代わりにしてたって噂だがなァ！","There's even a rumor that Daruk...
used it to fan himself sometimes."
51,talk49,ん？こんな時間に…,"Hm? What could you possibly want
at this hour?!"
52,talk50,"それはそうと アンタも
なかなかの業物""持ってんなァ！
まるで ダルケル様と共に厄災ガノンと戦った
ハイリアの英傑様の様だぜィ！
ワーーッハッハッハ！","That said, you've got a rather
fine blade already, don'tcha?

Come to think of it...you look just like
the Hylian Champion who fought the
Calamity alongside Daruk!
GWA HA HA HA!"
53,talk51,"しかしなんだなァ

アンタもハイリア人なら知ってっかも
知らねェが
100年前のハイリアの英傑様も
退魔の剣とかいう剣を持ってたらしいなァ","However...


Well, as a Hylian, you probably already
know this, but...

Apparently, 100 years ago, the Hylian
Champion had a legendary blade—
the sword that seals the darkness."
54,talk52,なんならアンタも探してみたらどうだィ？,"I bet you'd like to find it, eh?
You should go lookin'!"

him myself, heh! Thanks, brother."
63,talk63,"昔のハイリアの英傑様は巨岩砕きに負けねェ
退魔の剣とかいう すげェ剣持ってたらしいぜェ
しかしアンタも いい業物持ってんなァ…
どこで拾って来たのか知らねェけどよォ！","They say a long time ago the Hylian
Champion had a legendary sword—
the sword that seals the darkness.
It was apparently much stronger than
even the Boulder Breaker!

But hey, you've got a pretty sharp blade
yourself... I wonder where ya got it!"
64,talk64,"アンタハイリア人なのに知らねェのかィ？

100年前のハイリアの英傑様の扱う
退魔の剣とかいう剣は
そりゃもうすげェ業物だったらしィぜェ","You're a Hylian, but you don't know
about this?!

The blade that the Hylian Champion used
100 years ago, the sword that seals the
darkness, was apparently somethin' else."
65,talk67,あ～…いちちちち,Ugh... Ouch...
66,talk69,"早くルーダニアを追っ払いてェが
ユン坊が北の廃坑から帰ってこねェ事にはなァ","I've gotta fierce urge to go and crush
Rudania, but I can't until Yunobo returns

あれこそがダルケル様よォ！","See that statue up there?
That's Daruk!"
68,talk79,他に用はあるかィ？,Was there somethin' else ya needed?
69,talk80,"よかったら
家ん中にある宝を持ってってくれや
ダルケル様が使っていた特別な業物だから
きっと アンタの役に立つと思うぜェ","There's some treasure in my house.
Grab it. Keep it. It's yours.

It's a sharp blade that Daruk himself
once wielded. I'm sure you'll be able
to make good use of it!"
70,talk81,ちっくしょお！ルーダニアのヤロォ！,Drat! That blasted Rudania!
71,talk82,"最近ルーダニアが暴れ出したせいで
デスマウンテンの噴火が激しくてなァ","With Rudania runnin' wild recently,
Death Mountain's eruptions have
gotten real bad."
72,talk83,"ルーダニアってのは あそこに居るヤツだぜィ

100年前は
オレ達の守り神だったらしいがよォ…
アイツのせいで採掘はできねェわ
客足は減るわで困ってんでィ","Do ya see Rudania stompin' around up
there on the mountain?

They say that 100 years ago, it actually
used to protect our people from harm...
but that was then, and this is now!
Now all it does is mess up our mining
operations! We're all suffering because
it's stoppin' us from doin' business!"
73,talk84,毎度毎度大砲で火口へ追っ払ってんだが…,"I can't tell ya how many times we've
used the cannon to chase off that fiend."
74,talk85,ま～～た出て来やがったァ！！,But it always comes back!!
75,talk86,"これからまたルーダニアを追っ払うんだが
腰が痛くてなァ…","I was plannin' to drive off Rudania like
I always do, but then this blasted pain
in my back flared up outta nowhere..."
76,talk87,"…しっかしユン坊のヤロー
早く戻らねぇか…",That blasted Yunobo... When will he return?
77,talk88,"ユン坊ってのァ いつもオレと
ルーダニアを追っ払ってる若いヤツだァ","Yunobo is a young Goron who helps me
drive off Rudania."
78,talk89,"北の廃坑に腰の痛み止めを
取りに行ってくれたんだが まだ帰らねェ","He went to grab some painkillers for my
back from the Abandoned North Mine,
but he hasn't come back yet..."
79,talk90,ヤロー…どこをブラついてんだァ…,Slacker... I bet he's off somewhere wastin' time...
80,talk91,"なぁ アンタ

もしユン坊を見かけたら
オレが探してた って伝えてくれや
すまんが頼んだぜィ","Hey... If ya happen to see Yunobo,
