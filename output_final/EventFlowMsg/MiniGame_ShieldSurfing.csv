20,AboutCourse_Beginner,"この下へ真っ直ぐ進むと大きな橋があるわ
まずは その下まで滑ってもらいましょうか
本当に一本道のシンプルなコースだけど
これくらいの方が腕前の差がはっきり出るのよ","Straight down from here, you'll see a
big bridge. Why don't you start by
surfing your way there?
It's a pretty no-frills course, but it'll
help me get a bead on where you're at
with your technique."
21,AboutGame_00,"あら意外と慎重派なのね
じゃあ簡単に説明するわよ
ここからゴールまでいかに早く滑り降りるか？
いわゆる タイムアタックという競技ね！
盾サーフィンのやり方くらいは知っているわよね
盾を構えながら ジャンプ中に盾に乗るのよ！
別に途中で盾から降りても構わないし…
スピードに乗って空を飛んでもいいわよ！","Wow, you seem serious about this.
Not very surfer-like, but OK. I'll boil
it down for you.
Shield surfing is all about how fast you
can make it to the bottom of the hill.Quick check—you do know how to surf,
right? Just hold out your shield, and
then hop onto it in mid-jump.
For this course, I don't care if you stay
on your shield or not. You can go so fast
that you start to fly for all I care."
22,AskAboutShieldSurfing_Beginner,"分かったわ…じゃあ試験の代わりに
あなたに一つ意気込みを聞かせてもらうわね！
あなたにとって盾サーフィンとは？","Hmmm. Let's put the test aside for now
and just ask you straight out...What does shield surfing really mean
to you?"
23,AskCourse_Expert,"良い心がけね いい弟子を持ったものだわ
どっちのコースで腕を見せてくれるの？","That's my boy. Which slope were you
thinking for today?"
24,AskPurpose_Beginner,"元・プロ盾サーファーの私に
会いに来たのね？","You hiked all this way to meet the best
there ever was at shield surfing, right?"
25,AskPurpose_Expert,"今日はどうしたの？日頃の練習の成果を
私に見せに来てくれたのかしら？","So what brings you out here today? 
Wanna show me the results of all that
training I'm sure you've been doing?"
26,AskRetry_Beginner,"さてと…もう一度滑ってみる？
モチロン授業料として20ルピー頂くけど","So want to hit the slope again?
It'll be another 20 rupees for the
course fee."
27,AskRetry_Expert,さてと もう一度腕を見てあげましょうか？,So wanna hit the slope one more time?
28,AskRupee_Beginner,"そうね…一回につき20ルピー
ってトコかしらね？","How does... Hmmm... Is 20 rupees
a session OK with you?"
29,AskRupee_Expert,"それじゃ いつも通りだけど
授業料の20ルピーを頂くわよ？","The same charge as usual applies.
You have that 20 rupees for the course
fee, right?"
30,AskTraining_Beginner,"やっぱりね！でも私はもう引退した身…
雪の女王と呼ばれたのも随分と昔の話よ
でも そんな私でよければ
あなたの滑りを見てあげるわよ？","Knew it! Too bad for you that I'm retired,
huh? It's been years since anyone knew
me as the Duchess of Downhill.
But if you don't mind a few pointers from
a has-been, I'd be happy to critique
your technique."
31,CautionBigDoor_Expert,"あ あと！間違っても変な方に行っちゃダメよ！道を間違うと大きな石の扉があるんだけど
あんなのにぶつかったら大ケガするわよ","Oh, one more thing! Watch where you
surf!If you go the wrong way, you're bound
to slam into this giant stone door. Take
my word for it...that thing hurts."
32,ChangeBeginnerToExpert_Expert,"それじゃ上級コースでの滑りを見るわね
今までよりコースが長いけど頑張ってね！
ちなみに上級コースをクリアした暁には
クリアタイムごとに記念の盾を贈呈するわよ","Now let's see you hang on the advanced
slope. It's longer than the beginner
course, but stick with it!
The upside for the advanced course?
Finish it, and I'll give you a nice shield.
How nice all depends on your time!"
33,ChangeBeginnerToExpert_Expert1,"それじゃ上級コースでの滑りを見るわね
今までよりコースが長いけど頑張ってね！
あなたには盾を全て渡したから…
クリアタイムに応じた額の ルピーをあげるわ","Now let's see you hang on the advanced
slope. It's longer than the beginner
course, but stick with it!
You already won all the shields, so how
about I give you rupees instead?
The faster you finish, the more you get!"
34,ChangeExpertToBeginner_Expert,"それじゃ初級コースでの滑りを見るわね
初心を忘れていないか チェックさせて貰うわよ","Fine with me. Let's see how you handle
the beginner course. I'm very curious to
see if you can improve your old time."
35,Check_Money00,"モチロン上級コースの指導もタダじゃないわ！
20ルピーで引き受けてあげる！","Of course, you still have to pay the
instructor's fee, even on the advanced
course. Still 20 rupees, if you wondered."
36,Check_Money02,"モチロン授業料として
20ルピーは頂くけど","Of course, I'll still need that course fee
of 20 rupees."
37,EntranceExplain_Beginner,"それじゃあなたの滑りがどんなものか
簡単なコースで見せてもらいましょうか","What I suggest is starting simple with
a basic course, so we can take a look at
your downhill fundamentals."
38,EntranceTalk_Beginner,あら こんな山奥に何の用？,"Huh... Welcome to the middle of
nowhere. Population: us."
39,EntranceTalk_Beginner_Default,あ！ さては…！,Hey...wait a second...
40,EntranceTalk_Beginner_Default_00,"元・プロ盾サーファーの私でよければ
あなたの滑りを見てあげるわよ？","I'll watch you surf. If you don't mind a
little attention from a former pro, that is."
41,EntranceTalk_Beginner_Default_01,"授業料として一回につき20ルピー
いただくけど","Not for free, though. There's a 20-rupee
fee for every try."
42,EntranceTalk_Beginner_Default_02,"さてと…授業料として
20ルピーいただくけど いいかしら？","I will need you to cough up 20 rupees
as a course fee."
43,EntranceTalk_Beginner_SP,"その盾を持っているということは
あなた…！","If you're carrying THAT shield, then...
Whoa. This is big!"
44,EntranceTalk_Expert_Default,"あら あなた元気にしてた？
私は相変わらず元気よ！","Hey there. Everything going OK?
What, me? Psh, like anything
ever gets me down!"
45,EntranceTalk_Expert_SP,"随分と立派になったものね…
あなたの師匠として私も鼻が高いわ","You're practically a pro yourself these
days. You won't forget who taught you
everything you know, right?"
46,EntranceTalk_No_Shield,"…あら？
あなた盾をひとつも持ってないじゃない！
盾サーファーの基本は自給自足…
自分の盾は自分で探してくるのよ！","...Huh? You don't have a shield!


Self-sufficiency is the foundation of
shield surfing. Go find a shield and
come back!"
47,Exit_01,"じゃあ今日はここまでね
盾サーファーへの道は まだまだこれからよ！","Sure, take a breather. Your journey to
dominating the slopes has just started!"
48,Exit_02,"身体も冷えたでしょうし小屋まで送るわ
少し温まっていきなさいな","You must be cold. I'll see you back to the
cabin. You can warm up a bit there
before you go."

次に会った時の成長を楽しみにしてるわ","Thanks for stopping by. I look forward
to seeing you beat your record the next
time we meet."
50,ExplainExpertCourseToBeginner_Expert_00,"長いコース上で遭難されると大変だから
ゴールの位置は一応確認させてね？","Getting stranded on a long course is no
fun at all. Make sure you keep your goal
in the back of your mind, OK?"
51,ExplainExpertCourseToBeginner_Expert_01,"まず初級コースでゴールだった大きな橋の下を
真っ直ぐ進むじゃない？","First, go straight under the same bridge
that was your goal for the beginners'
course."
52,ExplainExpertCourseToBeginner_Expert_02,"つきあたったら そこで華麗なターンを決めて
また ずーっと真っ直ぐよ簡単でしょ？
上級コースのゴールには
大きな旗を立ててるから目標にしてね
大きく道を外れて迷ってしまったら
失格と見なして ここまで連れ戻すわよ！","Once you're through there, make a
sharp turn before going down a long
straightaway.
You should be able to see a pair of big
flags marking the finish line. Head for
those and you can't go wrong.
If you do manage to veer too far off
course, I'll just drag you back here."
53,Failed_00_00,"いくらなんでも少し遅すぎるわ！
今回はここまでよ！少し待ってなさい！","I've seen slowpokes before, but you're
something else! That's the end of the
run. Come on back!"
54,Failed_00_01,"頑張って…あなたなら もう少しいけるわよ！
今の半分ぐらいの時間でゴールできるはずよ？","You still have some room to improve,
but who doesn't? Stick with it, and I
think you can cut your time in half."
55,Failed_00_02,"どこを通っていくかは
スタート前に考えておくのを お勧めするわ？","One helpful thing is thinking about your
moves in advance. Don't get so caught
up in the run that you forget your goal."
56,Failed_01_00,"あら？ あの子の姿が見当たらないわ？！
こうしちゃいられない急いで捜さなきゃ！","Huh? How'd I lose track of him?! 
That's not good... I better find him
before it's too late!"
57,Failed_01_01,"まったく… どこに行こうとしてたのかしら？
危うく遭難するところだったのよ？","What in the world... Where did you think
you were going? You coulda gotten
stranded out there!"
58,Failed_01_02_00,"謝るぐらいなら最初からしないでちょうだい？
…あなたが無事でよかったわ","Don't apologize, just...don't do it to
begin with. Anyway, at least you're not
hurt. You had me worried!"
59,Failed_01_02_01,"…あなた私を凍死させるつもり？
寒いのは雪山だけで充分よ勘弁して…","...Yes? Obviously? It's cold. There's
snow. Yeah, it happens. It's gonna
happen to US if we don't get moving.Sheesh..."

時には休憩も必要よ…","You seem off your game today... Well,
everyone needs a break sometimes."
61,GoalBeginnerCourse_BadTime_Expert,"タイムは分秒ね…

冷たいようだけど まだまだ練習が必要ね！
次に進みたいのなら コースの先を見る事よ！
一見平らに見えても意外と凹凸があるものよ","You clocked in at :....
Don't take this the wrong way, but you
have some serious practicing to do.
You can't move on to the trickier slopes
until you've learned to keep your mind
on what's in front of you now.
What seems like a smooth stretch can
be bumpier than it looks!"
65,Goal_BadTime_Expert,"さてと… タイムは分秒ね…

練習したほうがいいわね…","You clocked in at :....
Is it me, or have you gotten worse?Maybe you should hit the beginner
slopes a few more times to bone up on
the fundamentals."
69,Goal_BadTime_Expert_dame1,"さてと… タイムは分秒ね…
ようやく初心者脱出 ってところかしら
私もこのタイムだったころは
段々調子が良くなってきて楽しい時期だったわ

さっきまではポーチに余裕があったようだけど…
この盾 あなたにもらってほしいから
ポーチを整理するまで次の滑りはお預けよ","Did you...pick up a shield along the way?
I could swear there was room in your
pack when you left...
It's fine. It's fine. I'll just hold on to it
until the next time you surf with some
free space in your gear."

あなたなら次に進んでも上手くやれそうね
合格よ上級コースの使用を許可するわ
期待しているんだから ガッカリさせないでよ？","Uh...are you pulling my leg? Though...
These days I'd probably answer the
same way.
Shield surfing is how we express a
passion that we can't put into words.
Surfing is its own meaning.
Funny, I started out thinking I'd teach
you a few tricks, but I ended up learning
something pretty important.
I think you'll be just fine on the
advanced course. But don't make me
regret that decision, OK? Haha..."

shape to advance yet. Sorry, but I'll have
to ask you to do the basic course again."
