However, I can still buy things from you.
Is there anything you'd like to sell?"
51,Talk19,"それにしてもお客さん そんなに矢を使うなんて
かなりの弓の使い手とみたねぇ～
うちの旦那も昔はシーカー族きっての
弓の使い手だったんだけどさぁ…
コッコにうつつを抜かして
すっかり腑抜けになっちまってさ…
我慢できなくなって
あたしは家を出てきちゃったんだよ…
ああ ごめんよ お客さんを見てたら
旦那のこと思い出しちまったさね
気にしないでおくれよし～","Hmm, at the rate you're going through
arrows, you must be quite the archer!

Back in the day, my husband was the 
finest archer in the whole Sheikah tribe...

These days, all he cares about are his
silly Cuccos. He's completely lost
his nerve. And his mind too.
*ahem* Sorry. He and I don't live
together anymore, but the sight of you
reminds me of him so much...
Please, don't mind me.
I'm just rambling now."
52,Talk21,"もしかしてこれから
外に出ていくのかい？
夜は素材を探しやすいけど
魔物も多いから気を付けるんだよ～","Are you going out?


It's a lot easier to find materials at night.
But then, there are also more monsters
around when it's dark. Please be careful!"
53,Talk23,"お兄さんのおかげで
胸の高鳴りがおさまらなくてね…
ちょっとだけ旦那が恋しくなっちゃったよ…","Kid, you've lifted my spirits so high I can
barely contain myself! I even miss my
husband at the moment. Just a tiny bit..."
54,Talk24,"おや もう帰っちゃうのかいさ～
さみしいね～
でも せっかく来てくれたんだし
良いこと教えてあげるわいさ～
お金に困ったら鉱石を売るといいよ～
どこの店でも高値で引きとってくれるわいさ～","Oh...are you planning to leave already?
That's too bad.

Well, while you're here, let me give you
a bit of advice.

If you need money, go ahead and sell
some ore. Any shop you find will buy
it at a premium price."
55,Talk25,"見てたよ お客さん！

すごい腕前さね～

いや～ ひっさびさに胸が高鳴ったわいさ～

あたしの旦那も弓の名手なんだけどさ～
今は訳あって ちょっと会えなくてさ…
だからさ こんな気持ち…
とんと ご無沙汰だったもんでさ
今すっごく興奮してるわいさ！

いや～ ホントにいいモン見せてもらったよ～
これは ほんの気持ちさね","Hey, kid! I saw you!


You were amazing!


Boy, what a shot in the heart that was!


My husband's a fine archer himself...
but we're living apart right now.

This feeling... It's been so, so long.


I'm so excited right now!


That really was something special to see.
In fact, here... A token of my thanks."
56,Talk26,"あの人もコッコにばかりうつつを抜かさず
弓の練習を続けてくれてたらねぇ…","If only my husband hadn't become obsessed with
Cuccos and had kept up with his archery skills...
If only..."
57,Talk28,"お客さん あたしとの約束
忘れないでおくれよ～",Don't go forgetting our promise now.
58,Talk29,"もう忘れてるんかいさ～

女神像のところにある燭台に
火をつけてくるって約束したわいさ～？
楽しみにしてるんだから
しっかりしとくれよ～","You forgot already?!


You were going to light the torches
by the Goddess Statue. I'm looking
forward to it, so don't mess it up!"
59,Talk30,"ふふっ この胸の高鳴り…
久々だわいさ～","Heh, my heart's practically singing...
I haven't felt this way in years."
60,Talk31,"お客さんの あの矢を射る姿…
いや～ いいモン見せてもらったわいさ～
ああ ごめんよ～ 
何か用さね～？","The way you handle that bow of yours...
A thing of beauty, I tell ya.

Heh, sorry. I'm getting carried away.
You lookin' to sell something?"
61,Talk32,"まったく…
用はそれだけかいさ～？",Well then! Was that all you wanted?
62,Talk34,いい買いっぷりさね～,I like how you shop.
63,Talk35,どうもね～,Thank you!
64,Talk36,またよろしくね～,Please come again!
65,Talk37,"見てたよ お客さん！

まぁ本当は矢で
火をつけてもらいたかったんだけどさ…
男ってのは女の期待を裏切る生き物だからねぇ

今は訳あって会ってないんだけど
あたしの旦那も気の利かない男でさ～
お客さん見てたら ちょっと思い出しちゃったよ
…でも なんだか
今すっごく興奮してるわいさ！

いや～何かありがとね～
これは ほんの気持ちさね","Hey, kid! I saw you!


Although... What I really wanted was for
you to light the fire using an arrow...

But I suppose a man is ultimately
doomed to betray a woman's
expectations. Don't you think?
I haven't seen him in a while...for various
reasons...but you being inconsiderate
reminds me of my husband.
*ahem* Anyway...


I'm so excited right now!!


Thank you for that. Here, take this as a
token of my appreciation."
66,Talk38,"それはそうと…

お客さん あたしとの約束
忘れないでおくれよ～","More importantly...


You better not forget the promise
you made!"
67,Talk39,暗くなってきたってねぇ…,It's getting dark...
