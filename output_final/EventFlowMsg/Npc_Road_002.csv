腹減って何か分けてほしいってんなら
俺に声かけたのは正解だな
なぜなら俺は肉の行商人だからな！","Huh? What's the matter?
Why the grumbles?

Well, if it's your tummy that's grumblin', 
you're talkin' to the right guy. I'm a
butcher, as luck would have it!
I'd be happy to sell you whatever
I've got in stock."
51,MSG_Futa_00_1,"腹が減ったのか？
だったら肉の行商人の俺に任せろ！","You hungry? Then you're talkin' to the
right meat man!"
52,MSG_Futa_01,"ん？ どうした？
俺から生肉の匂いがするってのか？
だとしたらビンゴだ！
そして俺はボンゴだ…肉を売って歩いてる
正解のご褒美に肉料理の基本を教えてやろう

ジュージューと よく焼く事！

それと持っていればの話だが…
岩塩を加えると うまさ倍増だ！","What? You smell it, don't you? 
Like raw meat, wafting through the air?
Well, you guessed right! It's me!
I'm Mezer. I'm a wandering butcher.
Huh. That sounds a touch weird when
I say it out loud like that.
How 'bout I whet your appetite with a
little cooking tip? I've got just the thing
to make your cuisine sizzle!
All you gotta do...is add a dash of
rock salt to double your dish's
deliciousness!"
53,MSG_Futa_01_1,"肉料理の基本は よく焼く事！
岩塩を加えると うまさ倍増だ！
その肉なら俺が売ってやるぞ","The secret to delicious meat is to grill
it well! And adding a dash of rock salt
doubles down on the deliciousness.
You feel that sensation? That's your
mouth watering. That's what makes me
such a good salesman right there."
54,MSG_Futa_02,"どうした？""道に迷ったか？

カカリコ村なら まだまだ北だが
双子馬宿なら すぐそこだぜ
いつもは馬宿で肉を売っているけど
何なら ここで売り買いしてもいいぜ","What's goin' on with you?
Are you lost or somethin'?

Kakariko Village is a ways north of here.
If you're goin' to Dueling Peaks Stable,
it's not much farther from here.
You can usually find me at the stables,
but if you can't wait, we can do a little
business right here."
55,MSG_Futa_02_1,"カカリコ村なら まだまだ北だ
肉がほしいなら ここで売り買いしてもいいぜ","Kakariko Village is a bit farther north of
here. If what you're looking for is a little
fresh meat, I'm willing to trade with you."
56,MSG_Futa_03,"どうした？""話し相手がほしいか？

俺は肉の話しか できないぜ？

肉の話というか肉を売る話だけど
それでよければ さっそく…","What's up? You lookin' for someone
to talk to?

Fine by me, as long as we're talkin'
meat, 'cuz that's all I really have
that's worth talking about.
Finest meat in the land, a-yup.
You, uh, fixin' to buy some?"
57,MSG_Futa_03_1,"肉の話というか肉を売る話だけど
それでよければ さっそく…","Speaking of meat, and I'm sure we were,
I'm selling some, so if you want to buy,
let's get down to business!"
58,MSG_Futa_04,"ん？馬宿の中で休まないのかって？

そりゃあ ふかふかベッドで寝たいけど
馬宿に泊まるだけの売り上げがなくてね
何なら兄ちゃん…
肉を買ってくれるか？","Huh? You got opinions about where
I rest my head at night? Well, I can't
see how it's any of your business.
Sure, I'd love to stay in a nice, comfy
bed. Who wouldn't? But the meat trade
ain't exactly rakin' in the dough.
Why not help a fella out by stockin'
up, as long as you're here?"
59,MSG_Futa_04_1,"兄ちゃん
俺の売ってる肉を買ってくれるか？","Hey. Hey, buddy. You wanna buy
some meat?"
60,Near00,肩ロース…,Top-quality steak!
61,Near01,すじ肉…,Tasty meats!
62,Near02,肩ロース… レバー…,Farm fresh and ready!
63,Near03,サーロイン…,Juicy sirloin!
64,Near04,雨かよ…,It's raining...
65,Rest_00,"ん？""俺か？
たまには休まないと体がきつくてな
もちろん休んでるのは体だけ
商売の方は休まずやってるぜ
売り物は…肉だ","Huh? Me? I gotta rest sometime,
don't I? Of course, my body may
need rest, but meat waits for no one!
So you better believe I'm open for
business. I sell...meat."
66,Rest_01,"天気が悪い時は無理せず休む
少なくとも俺はそうしてるぜ
もちろん休んでるのは体だけ
商売の方は休まずやってるよ
売り物は…肉だ","When the weather's taken a turn for
the worse, it's best to take it easy and
catch up on your rest.
At least that's what I do. Of course, the
weather may be crummy, but meat waits
for no one!
So you better believe I'm open for
business. I sell...meat."
67,Rest_02,"ひゃー！""降ってきやがった！
こりゃ しばらく雨宿りだな
もちろん雨宿りしながらでも
商売の方は休まずやってるぜ
売り物は…肉だ","Oh, man! It's raining fierce out! Guess
I'll have to take cover for a while.

But even though I'm wet to the bone,
meat waits for no one!

So you better believe I'm open for
business. I sell...meat."
68,RetMSG_Futa_00,"なんだよ… その憐れむような顔は

こんな朽ちたような冴えない場所でも
俺にとっては くつろぎの空間なんだ
同情するなら肉を買ってくれ！

…お安くしとくぜ","What? Don't give me that look!


Yeah, maybe it's a bit of a wasteland
here... But I find it peaceful, being all
alone out in the wilderness.
If you've got time to judge, you've got
time to buy some meat from me!
Maybe I can even cut you a deal."
69,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,同情するなら肉を買ってくれ！,"You know what would cheer me up right
now? If you bought some of my meat.
That's what."
70,RetMSG_Futa_01,"どうした？
その顔… さては腹ペコ君か？
腹が減っては冒険もできまい…
肉を焼いて食ったら元気が出るぞ
ちょっと待ってろ
俺が肉を売ってやるから…","What is it? That face... Is that...the face
of hunger? You can't adventure on an
empty stomach.
Grill some meat to get your strength
back! In fact, why don't you give me
a sec, and I'll sell you some meat."
71,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,"腹ペコなんだろ？
俺が肉を売ってやろう","What's the matter? Aren't you hungry?
I'll sell ya some meat."
72,RetMSG_Futa_02,"ん？どうした？
その顔… さては塩分が足りてないか？
だとしたら ちょうどよかった
俺は岩塩を売っている
肉も売ってるから
一緒に買ってったらどうだ？","Huh? What's your problem?
You look real salty... Wait, is that what
you're after? Well, you're in luck!
I sell rock salt and meat, and I tell you
what, they do go great together!"
73,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"塩分が足りてないなら岩塩を売ってやろう
ついでに肉もどうだ？","If you're not getting enough salt in your
diet, I'll sell you some rock salt. And
why not some meat while I'm at it?"
74,RetMSG_Futa_03,"ん？ どうした？
歩きすぎて疲れちゃったか？
双子馬宿なら すぐそこだってのに
もし気力がヤバいなら肉でも食え
たしかこの辺りに肉を売ってるやつが…

あっ俺か！","Huh? What's the matter with you?
You look right tuckered out. You know,
Dueling Peaks Stable is real close.
If you're feelin' a mite peckish, I've
got just the thing to get your strength
back. A nice hunk o' meat!"
75,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"双子馬宿なら すぐそこだ
体力がヤバいなら肉を売ってやろう","Dueling Peaks Stable is right over there.
If you're feeling too tired to make it, how
about a little meat to charge you up?"
76,RetMSG_Futa_04,"ん？肉を買いに来たのか？

これから自分の寝ぐらに帰るところだけど
もちろん商売が優先だ
それに ケモノやトリの肉が売れることで
俺は魚や野菜を食うことができる","Huh? You fixin' to buy some meat?


I was just about to set myself down
for some sleep, but business always
comes first! And meat is my business!
I'll let you in on a little secret of mine...
Personally? I don't touch the stuff. I'm
more of a fruit-and-veggies guy myself."
77,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"自分の寝ぐらに帰るところだけど
客がいるなら そっちが優先だ","I was just headed back to my camp, but
customers come first. Well...second,
because meat always comes first!"
78,SavedLv1_00,"ふぅ""食べられちまうとこだったぜ！
俺の肉なんか うまくないって！","Phew! I coulda sworn I was about to
get eaten! Which would have been bad
for everyone, because I taste AWFUL."
79,SavedLv1_01,"ふぅ！
あぶねぇ… あぶねぇ…","Phew! Sure is dangerous out here.
I probably...shouldn't have gone alone..."
80,SavedLv2_00,"くっそ！
魔物にとっちゃ俺は餌かよ！","Aw, dang! I guess I'm nothin' but a
walkin' pile of monster grub!"
81,SavedLv2_01,"くっそ！
売り物の肉の匂いに誘われたのかな！","Aw, dang! They must have been
lured by the many fine meats I've
got here in my bag!"
82,SavedLv3_00,"やれやれ…
俺が肉になるところだったぜ！","Oh me, oh my... I coulda sworn I was
gonna be somethin's dinner right there!"
83,SavedLv3_01,"やれやれ…
売り物の肉も かろうじて無事だったぜ","Oh me, oh my... At least my delicious
selection of meats didn't get damaged!"
84,Talk01,"もちろん俺の売る肉はすべて上物！
損はさせないぜ","I carry only the finest meats.
I guarantee these are top-choice
provisions, or your rupees back!"
85,Talk02,"他はどうする？
遠慮なんか するんじゃないぜ","Anything else you need? Be a shame
to let all this meat go to waste."
86,Thanks00,"助けてくれてありがとよ
礼受け取ってくれよ","Thank you for saving me. Here, I want
you to have this."
