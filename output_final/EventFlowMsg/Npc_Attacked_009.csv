1,After00,"私たち ここでキノコ狩りをしてたんだけど
いきなり魔物に襲われちゃって…
お姉ちゃんが マックストリュフが見つかるまで
帰らないなんて言うからいけないのよ","We were minding our own business,
hunting for truffles, and then wham!
Monsters out of nowhere.
I blame my sister, really. She's the one
who refuses to go home until we find
some hearty truffles."
2,Atacked00,あぁ あんなところに魔物が…,"Maybe if I don't move, the monster won't
see me..."
3,Atacked01,どうしよう どうしよう…,"I read about what you're supposed to do
in these situations, but now that it's
happening, I can't remember any of it."
4,Failed00,"イッタアアァイ…

お姉ちゃんが こんなところで
キノコ狩りするなんて言うから いけないのよ…","Ooooh... I blame my sister entirely for
this. \""Let's go hunt for truffles!\"" she
says. \""It'll be fun!\"" she says."
5,Failed01,"アイタァ…
もう なんなの突然 あいつら…
だから私は キノコ狩りなんか 
いやだって言ったのよ…","I never even saw them coming! This is
exactly why I didn't want to go truffle
hunting. Lousy Nat..."
6,GoodBye00,"お姉ちゃんが こんな所でキノコ狩りする
って言うから こんな目にあっちゃうんだよ…","It was my sister's harebrained idea
to hunt for truffles here that got us
into this mess."
7,Guardian00,ガーディアンが来るわよ！,"Great! A Guardian's on its way. Because
apparently we didn't have enough to
deal with!"
8,Meeting00,"私は こんなところでキノコを採ってたら
命がいくつあっても足りないって言ってたのよ
なのに お姉ちゃんたら すっかりキノコが
お金に見えちゃってるみたいで…","I told Nat that our luck would run out
in about five minutes flat if we went
truffle hunting here.
But when those visions of rupees start
dancing in her head, there's no getting
through to her anymore."
9,Meeting01,"いいから早く キノコを探しなさい！

マックストリュフが見つかるまでは
帰らないからね！ メグ！","Less talking, more hunting!Remember, Meghyn, nobody goes home
until we find those hearty truffles!"
10,Meeting02,ひえぇぇ…,"*sigh* She's right. The sooner we find
those truffles, the sooner this will all be
over with."
11,Near00,助かった…,I can't believe we're alive.
12,Near01,早く帰りたい…,I want to go home...
13,PairAtacked00,お姉ちゃんがまだ…魔物に…,Why won't they leave my sister alone?!
14,PairAtacked01,お願い… お姉ちゃんを助けて！,Please help my sister! Help Nat!
15,PairFailed00,あぁ お姉ちゃん… なんてこと…,"Nat! Oh, this is just perfect..."
16,PairFailed01,いやーっ！ お姉ちゃーん！,"It's not too late for my sister, right?
Right?!"
17,SavedLv1_00,"あぁ こわかった…

これは お礼よ受け取って","That was exciting...up until it turned
terrifying. Thanks for all your help."
18,SavedLv1_01,"あぁ あなたが来てくれなかったら
どうなっていたことか…
ありがとう これを受け取って","I'd say I don't know what would have
happened to me without you, but I'm
pretty sure I do, and I'm glad it didn't."
19,SavedLv2_00,"すすす… すごい！
あなたのおかげで助かったわ！
これは気持ちよ受け取って！","Let's see... Huh. I'm still in one piece.
How about that?"
20,SavedLv2_01,"なんてお礼を言ったらいいのか…

ほんとに ありがとう！
これは ほんの気持ちよ受け取って！","Just when I was sure I knew how I was
going to die... The world is full of
surprises. Like you!"
21,SavedLv3_00,"ありがとう！！
あなたは命の恩人よ！
ぜひ お礼をさせてね！","We all have to die someday, but thanks
for making sure it wasn't today."
22,SavedLv3_01,"あなたって何者？
ほんとに ありがとう！！
こんな物じゃ感謝しきれないけど…
受け取って！","I don't know your name, but I owe you
my life. That's kind of awkward.
Um...do you want this?"
