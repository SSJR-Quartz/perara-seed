1,"""0000""",あなたは？,Who are you?
2,NHateru_around_Near,うーん…,Hmm...
3,NHateru_around_Talk001,"ありゃ？ こんなところに
人が来るなんて珍しいわね","Huh? It really is a rare thing to see
another person all the way up here."
4,NHateru_around_Talk003,"アタシ？ アタシは見ての通り
どこにでもいる旅の冒険家よ
こういう人気の少ないところは
魔物も多くて危ないんだけど…
その分 お宝とかが
転がってることも多いんだよね！
だからアタシは よく こういう高い所から
怪しい場所がないか探してみるんだ！
キミも そこの岩場に立って眺めてみなよ
いろいろ怪しい場所が見つかると思うよ！","Who am I? As you can see, I am a
traveling adventurer, much like yourself.
I'm sure our kind are found all over.
People rarely come to places like this, so
there are lots of monsters. It's really
pretty dangerous...
But it's all worthwhile when you stumble
upon some treasure just lying around!

That's why I try to climb up to great
vantage points like this! They're swell
places for spotting anything suspicious.
See that rock over there? You should
stand on it and look around—I bet you'll
spot something suspicious."
5,NHateru_around_Talk006,"あ！ そうそう！
せっかく会えたのも何かの縁だし…
この辺にある食材は
好きに持って行っていいよ！
そこの鍋も勝手に使ってくれていいからね！","Oh, I know! To celebrate the good
fortune of meeting someone else
up here...
I invite you to help yourself to any of the
cooking ingredients around here!
Feel free to use that cooking pot, too!"
6,NHateru_around_Talk007,"何か探す時は高い所！""覚えとくと いいよ！","If you're trying to find something,
looking from somewhere high up is
the best! Remember that!"
