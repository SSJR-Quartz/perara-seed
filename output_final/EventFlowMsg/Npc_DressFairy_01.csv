7,Revival00,"う～～～ん？

そなたがわらわを解き放ったのか？

ふぅん…？もっと筋骨隆々の
たくましい者かと思うたが
ホッホ…
わらわは華奢な男子も守備範囲じゃ","Mmmmmm. So you're the one who
released me.

I was expecting someone...bigger,
I guess...

But a slim little lad like you will do just
fine. Yes."
8,Revival00_1,"さて そなたのおかげで
力を取り戻せたようじゃ
引き換えに…
そなたの服を強くしてたもう
ただ それなりの材料が必要じゃが…
試されるかの？","Thanks to you, my power has been
returned to me.

And I think you'll agree—a good deed
deserves a good reward.

I can enhance your clothing, but I
require the necessary materials to do it."
9,Talk00,"また来たんじゃのぅ？
さぁ服を見せてたもれ","Ah, you've come here again?
OK, let me see your clothes."
10,Talk01,"ふむ…しばしの別れじゃな？
服を手に入れたら いつでも来るがよいぞ","Hrm... So long for now, I suppose?
Once you have some clothing you
want to upgrade, come back anytime."
11,Talk02,"フム… わらわの姉妹には
まだ力を取り戻せてない者が おるようじゃ
やつらの力が戻ったなら
さらに服を強くできるぞよ","Hm... It seems like a few of my sisters
haven't yet recovered their power.

Once they have their power back, I can
make your clothes even stronger."
12,Talk04,では そこに直れ,One moment...
13,Talk06,できたぞえ,There we go.
14,Talk08,では服を選んでたもれ,Then please choose some clothes for me.
15,Talk09,他の服も やってほしいのか？,"Any other clothing items you want me to
work on?"
16,Talk10,"なにゆえ強くできぬのか
わらわが教えてやろう","I can't enhance your clothing,
but let me tell you why..."
17,Talk11,"…呆れた装備しておらんのはともかく
服を一つも持っておらんではないか！
強くできそうな服を手に入れたら
また来るがよい","Oh! You don't have any clothes at all?
Well, if you get some, come back and
I'll see if I can enhance them for you."
18,Talk12,"今のわらわなら そなたの服を
少しだけ""強くできるぞえ","With the power available to me...
I should be able to enhance your
clothing a little bit."
19,Talk13,"今のわらわなら そなたの服を
だいぶ""強くできるぞえ","With the power available to me...
I can enhance your clothing
a fair amount."
20,Talk14,"今のわらわなら そなたの服を
かなり""強くできるぞえ","With the power available to me...
I can greatly enhance your clothing."
21,Talk15,"今のわらわなら そなたの服を
最大まで""強くできるぞえ","With the power available to me...
I can enhance your clothing to the max."
22,Talk16,"姉妹達を全員解き放ったのじゃな？
礼を言うぞ
わらわ達の力が必要なら

25,Talk19,見参っ！,"Here I am, at your service!"
26,Talk20,推参っ！,Here I am!
27,Talk21,登場っ！,Ready to help!
28,Talk22,"それではを
強くするぞ？","Now then, I'll enhance the
."
29,Talk23,"ふむ…を
強くすれば よいのじゃな？","Hrm... You want the 

enhanced, correct?"
30,Talk24,"わらわにを強くせよと
申すのか？","You're telling me to enhance the
?"
31,Talk25,"強くするのは
で相違無いな？","You want to enhance the
, correct? "
32,Talk26,"すまぬ…わらわの力を もってしても
強くできない服も あるのじゃ…","Sorry, there are some clothes, even with
my powers, that cannot be enhanced..."
33,Talk27,"悪いが その服は強くできん
違うのを選んでたもれ","Sorry, but I can't enhance that clothing
item. Choose a different one."
34,Talk28,"その服は強くできんようじゃ
別のものに変更してたも","Seems like that clothing item can't be
enhanced. Please choose something
else."
35,Talk29,"どうやらその服は強くできんようじゃのぅ
別の服はどうじゃ？","Seems like that clothing item can't be
enhanced. How about another piece
of clothing?"
36,Talk30,"その服は わらわの力だけでは無理じゃ
姉妹が力を取り戻せればのぅ…","That clothing item can't be enhanced
with my power alone. But if my sisters
regained their powers..."
37,Talk31,"その服を強くせよ と申すなら
もっと姉妹の助けが必要じゃ…","If you want me to enhance that clothing
item, I will need the help of my sisters..."
38,Talk32,"無理を言うな
他にも姉妹が目覚めておるなら話は別じゃが…","Don't be unreasonable. Though, if my
sisters were awakened, it might be a
different story..."
39,Talk33,"そなた…他の姉妹も助けてたもれ
さすれば その服を強くできるやもな","You... Please go help my sisters.
Doing so will allow me to enhance that
piece of clothing."
40,Talk34,"強くしようにも元となる材料が足りんようじゃ
覚え帰るがよい","Even if I wanted to, you don't have 
enough materials. Be on your way, and
think about bringing me what I need."
41,Talk35,"何を馬鹿な
強くするための材料が足りんではないか","What absurdity! You don't have enough
materials to enhance that!"
42,Talk36,そなた材料が足りん事を知っての言いぐさか？,"Don't make excuses... You haven't got
enough materials."
43,Talk37,"材料が足りんぞえ
他の服なら どうじゃ？","You don't have enough materials.
How about another piece of clothing?"
44,Talk38,なんじゃ？やめるのか,What? You want to stop?
45,Talk39,そなた…わらわを待たせるのか？,"Are you...are you going to make
ME wait?"
46,Talk40,どうした？さっさと決めてたも,What is it? Hurry up and choose.
47,Talk41,ふむ…選び直すんじゃな？,Hrm... You want to choose again?
48,Talk42,"退""出っ！",Good-bye!
49,Talk43,撤収っ！,So long!
50,Talk44,退場っ！,And gone!
51,Talk45,退室っ！,See ya!
52,Talk46,"…しかし わらわが強くできそうな服を
持っておらんようじゃ
どれ…一応確認してやろう
そなたの手持ちの服を見せてたも","...However, you are lacking any clothing
that I can enhance.

Here, let's take a look. Maybe I can
see what's stopping me from helping."
53,Talk47,"ふむ…他の服も強うしてやろうと思うたが
もう無理なようじゃ","Hrm... I wanted to enhance other pieces
of clothing, but that does not seem
possible."
54,Talk48,"服と素材を手に入れるか姉妹の力を戻したら
強くしてやれるやも知れぬ","If you get clothes and materials or if you
restore my sisters' powers, then I believe
I can help you."
55,Talk49,"新たに服と素材を手に入れたら
またわらわを訪れるがよい","If you get new clothes and materials,
you should return to me."
56,Talk50,"できたぞえ
良い具合じゃの…
強くした服はな同じ種類でそろえると
まれに不思議な力が現れることがあるのじゃ","There we go.
Oh, while you're here...

Some sets, if you enhance all parts of
them twice, can give you a nice extra
set bonus when you wear them.
This isn't true of everything I can
enhance, sadly..."
