14,Initial,"よぉ若いの！
こんな山奥にまで どうしただか？
まあ誰でも大歓迎するだ！
せっかくだし… オラが考えた遊び
雪玉ボウル""やっていかないか？","Hail, kiddums! Nice to meet a fresh face
in these parts. It's not every day I get
company this high in the hills.
Can't give you a warm welcome...buuuut
how about a game I made up: Snowball
Bowling! Or as I call it, Snowling!"
15,Initial_00,"若いの！""雪玉ボウル やりたくなっただか？
いつでも歓迎だ！","Hallooooo, kiddums! If you wanted to try
a round of Snowball Bowling, then you're
in luck, because this is the place!"
16,about_snowbowl_03,それじゃ気を取り直して頑張るだ！！,Ooookaaaaay! Here we snooooow!
17,about_snowbowl_04,それじゃ頑張るだ！！,"Well, good luck!"
18,area_out_00,"おいおい！ちょいと待つだ！！
ゲーム中に どこに行くだ？","Are you flaking out?! You haven't
finished your round of SNOW BOWLING!"
19,area_out_01,"あらら…そいつはすまねぇだ！
ちょいと待ってて欲しいだ！！",Oh... Whoopsie-doodle! Hold on a tick!
20,area_out_02,"悪かったな若いの！
坂道だから こればっかりは勘弁して欲しいだ！","Sorry about that, kiddums! 'Til I learn to
control the weather, there's not much I
can do about these icy slopes."
21,area_out_03,とりあえずここまで戻ってくるだ！,"Skate just a minute there! I bet you'll
score more points if you come back over
this way."
22,area_out_04,"まったく…危なっかしいだなぁ！
雪玉ボウルは紳士の遊び ルールは守るだよ？","Snowly moly... What's gotten into you?
Snowball Bowling is a civilized game.
There are rules!"
23,ask_again,"ピンが一気に倒れる瞬間が
たまらなく気持ちいいだ！ やってみるだか？","There's no cooler feeling than smashing
all the pins at once! But see for yourself!
Go on, have a ball!"
24,ask_payment,"うれしいねぇ！ でも タダじゃないだよ！
参加料に20ルピー貰うが いいだか？","Ah, the sweet music of \""yes\""! There's a
catch, though. One game costs a cool
20 rupees to play. Still up for a round?"
25,break_00,ん？どうしただ？,"Hrm? Something on your mind, kiddums?"
26,break_01,"やめるって… もう疲れただか？
見かけによらず体力ねぇんだな！","Snowly moly! You're tired already?!
I didn't have you pinned as the quitting
type!"
27,break_02,"途中でやめたいなら やめてもいいだが
参加料は返さねぇだぞ？","If your throwing arm is frozen solid,
suit yourself, but I'm keeping the fee.
Think of it as learning the hard way!"
28,end,"そうだか…
やりたくなったら声をかけるだよ","Ooooookaaaaay. Ice of you to stop by!
If you're in the mood, I'll always be
happy to line 'em up for you!"
29,explanation_00,"おっ興味をもってくれて ありがたいだ！
じゃあ ルールを説明するだぁよ
まず！
坂の下に 10本のピンと呼ぶ柱が並んでいるだよ","What a sweet boy to show an interest!
If you don't know the rules, I can
explain them in a flurry.At the foot of the hill, we have 10, count
'em, 10 pillars or \""pins.\"""
30,explanation_01,"そこへ この坂の上から雪玉を転がして
できるだけ多く倒すだぁよ！","Give that snowball a good, hearty toss
from the tippy-top of the hill to try and
knock over all the pins you can!"
31,explanation_02,"雪玉は転がりながらどんどんでっかくなって
坂の下では巨大雪玉が ピンを弾き飛ばすだ！","The ball might take a few detours on its
ride down the hill, but any pins it hits
when it reaches bottom are done for!"
32,game_start,"それじゃあこの雪玉さ使っていいから
頑張って ピンを倒すだよ！
この遊び雪玉は2回まで転がせるだ！","This is the snowball you'll use. It might
not look like much, but it's snow joke.
You get two rolls. Knock 'em flat!"
33,game_start_00,"どうも ありがとうだ！！
だば準備するから ちょっと待つだよ…","Aha! Play bells are ringing! I gotta set up
the pins, but I'll be back in a flurry."
34,game_start_01,"もし1回で ピンを全部倒せたらストライク！
という プロ級のプレイだ！
んで2回目で ピンを全部倒せたらスペア！
という まあまあなプレイだ！","If you can knock over all 10 pins in one
roll, that's a strike. Only the most
snowtorious bowlers can pull that off!
A spare is when it takes both tries to
finish the job. Not as good as a strike,
but nothing to sneeze at!"
35,prize_00,"ピンをよく見て玉がどう転がるか予測する！
この基本をよーく覚えておく事だ！","You gotta look at your pins and see the
ball hitting 'em in your mind. That's the
key to it all!"
36,prize_01,"本とは残念な結果だっただな
これに懲りずまた遊びに来てほしいだよ！","Only ... That's gotta sting. My advice?
Stay frosty and play again!"
37,prize_02,"本だか…
まあまあだな
賞品として これを渡すから
もう1回遊んでいくだよ！","How many pins? Eh, ? That's decent.
Tell you what, I'll give you a sampler
prize to get you shivering for more!"
38,prize_03,"いや～っ""惜しかっただな！
これは賞品だ受け取るだよ！","Ooooh, snow close! A throw like that
deserves some kinda prize. Here ya go!"
39,prize_04,"若いの！すげぇだな！
特別な道具を分けてやるだよ！","Well, bowl me over, kiddums! A snowing
like that deserves an ice prize. How's
about this snowball-making doohickey?"
40,prize_05,コイツは冷気を発射する力があるとか…,I hear this'll freeze things but good.
41,prize_06,オラは戦いが怖くて使った事が無いだ…！,"I'm too chill to fight, so I've never
seen it in action with my own two
peepers."
42,prize_07,"と思っただが…""荷物がいっぱいみたいだな？
代わりに これを受け取るだ！","Leastways, I'd offer it to you if you
weren't snowverloaded with stuff. Will
this do instead?"
43,prize_08,"全部倒すたぁ すげぇもんだ！
これ""受け取るだよ！","You knocked 'em all down flat! That
was no mean sleet, kiddums. I got you
a special prize for pulling that one off!"
44,prize_09,"若いの！すげぇだな！
これは賞品だ受け取るだよ！","Well, whaddaya know, kiddums! Just for
that, you get a prize."
45,refuse,"ひー ふー みーあれれ…
ルピーが足りないだよ？","Is this all of the rupees you have?
There's snow way this is enough!"
46,restart,さてもう1回遊んでいくだか？,"Soooooooo... What do you think about
giving it one more whirl?"
47,restart_end,"そっかぁ…まあ オラはいつもここにいるだ！
気が向いたら また遊びに来るだよ！","No problem. I love the pins too much to
ever leave! You bet your snowball I'll be
here when you're ready for more."
48,result_00,"一投目と合わせて本だか…
若いの！遊び方は理解できてるだか…？","With both throws together, you got....
Not as easy as it looks, eh, kiddums?"
49,result_01,"一投目と合わせて本だか…

57,result_09,"おおおっと！記録は本！！
ストライクってヤツだ！輝かしい記録だ！！","WHOA! All  pins! That there's a strike!
Snow 'em how it's done, kiddums!"
58,result_10,落ち着いて二投目いってみるだ！,"Take a deep breath, and go for broke on
