17,talk06,"それにしても…

「何も無い」で有名なアッカレ地方へ

Akkala is famous for... Well, nothing.
So I have to ask... What could you

18,talk07,"そうか旅か…

なら頼みがある

妹のツヤが大の虫好きでな

とある虫の実物を見たいそうなんだが
ボクには絶対に教えてくれないのだ
身内には言えない事情が あるのだろう…

なので
彼女から その虫を聞きだしてくれないか？
まぁ その…誕生日プレゼント
というやつだ","I see... A traveler, eh?


In that case, I have a request for you.


My little sister, Gleema, is a huge fan
of insects. I know, I don't get it either.

But apparently there's a certain insect
she's dying to see in real life. She won't
tell me about it, though.
I suppose there are some things you
just can't talk about with those you're
closest to.
Anyway, would you mind talking to her
and trying to figure out which silly
insect she's so crazy about?
It's for her birthday... Think of it as a
special birthday favor. Ooh, or even
a birthday quest. Look, just do it, OK?"
19,talk08,"ジュン…
ここの次女担当は花畑だ
姉のカイファなら裏で家畜の世話をしている","I'm Jana, the second eldest.
I'm in charge of the flower patch.

My big sister, Kaifa, is in the back taking
care of the livestock."
20,talk09,"エノキダ？ああ…

その大工なら ここに立ち寄ったぞ

「一から村を作る」とか言ってたな…
確かアッカレ湖の方へ向かったはずだ","Hudson? Oh...


That carpenter did stop by here,
as it were.

He said something like, \""I'm gonna
build a village from the ground up.\""
I think he went off toward Lake Akkala."
21,talk11,"アッカレ湖なら ここから東だ
気になるなら向かってみるといい","Lake Akkala is to the east of here.
If you're curious, you should head
over there."
22,talk13,貴様か…,So. It's YOU.
23,talk14,早いなもう目覚めたのか？,"It's so early, but you're already up?"
24,talk15,やぁ おはよう,Hey. Mornin'.
25,talk16,やぁ日が高くなってきたな,"Hey. The sun's pretty high in the sky,
don't you think?"
26,talk17,やぁ生憎の天気だな,Hey. Unfortunate weather we're having.
27,talk18,やぁ,Hey.
28,talk19,涼しくなってきたな,"It sure has cooled off, hasn't it?"
29,talk20,やぁ宿が無いなら ウチで泊まっていけ,"Hey. If you're looking for a place
to crash, you can stay here."
30,talk21,ボクに用か？,Need me for something?
31,talk22,"エノキダという大工なら

「一から村を作る」とか言って
アッカレ湖の方へ向かったぞ","If you're looking for Hudson
the carpenter...

He said something about building a
village from the ground up. Then he
headed off toward Lake Akkala."
32,talk23,"ミナッカレ馬宿だ

東の牧場の先から
アッカレ湖とアッカレ海が一望できるぞ
名物といえばそれくらい…かな","This is the South Akkala Stable.


From just past the farm to the east,
you can take in a sweeping view of 
Lake Akkala and the Akkala Sea.
That's about it as far as local
attractions go..."
33,talk24,そういえば…,"Ah, that reminds me..."
34,talk25,"妹のツヤなら
今日もその辺で虫を探しているだろう","My little sister, Gleema, is looking
for insects around here today."
35,talk26,"妹のツヤは…""今は寝ているかな","My little sister, Gleema, is probably
asleep right now."
36,talk27,"しかし一体 ツヤは
どんな虫を見たがっているのか…","But I wonder what kind of insect
Gleema wants to see..."
37,talk28,"なんで ボクには教えてくれないのか…

頼む代わりに聞いてくれないか？","I wonder why she won't tell me
about it...

Please... Can you ask her for me?"
38,talk29,起きたら聞き出してくれないか？,"When she wakes up, will you ask her?"
39,talk30,"ツヤは…

な…なんと
よりによってトンボを見たがってるのか？！
しかもポカポカヤンマ""ヒンヤリヤンマ
ビリビリヤンマの3種類も…
グ グゥ…トンボか…
あの目を思い出しただけでも おぞましい…","Gleema...


She... She...wants to see dragonflies,
of all things?!

And to make it worse, three different
kinds?! A warm darner, a cold darner,
and an electric darner...
Eek... It had to be dragonflies, didn't it?
Just thinking about those nasty eyes...
Blargh! So gross!"
40,talk31,"ポカポカヤンマ""ヒンヤリヤンマ
ビリビリヤンマを ボクの所まで持って来てくれ
ツヤを驚かせたいので
この事は彼女には秘密だぞ","Bring me a warm darner, cold darner,
and electric darner, please.

I want to surprise Gleema, so don't tell
her about this!"
41,talk32,"それはそうと…

ポカポカヤンマ""ヒンヤリヤンマ
ビリビリヤンマを持ってるんじゃないか？","But enough about that...


Have you secured a warm darner,
cold darner, and electric darner?"
42,talk32_2,"…ゴクン

よし…なら そいつらを
ボクにくれないか？","*gulp*


Right... In that case, may I have them?"
43,talk32_3,"…

……

…ううっ","...


...


Ewww..."
44,talk32_4,"やっぱりダメだ！
直接 妹に…ツヤに渡してくれ！","BAH! I CAN'T DO THIS! Please give
them to her...just...give them to
Gleema yourself!"
45,talk33,"花をいじってる関係上
妹と同じく虫には抵抗が無いつもりだ
…ただ1つの虫を除いてな","So long as they don't tamper with my
flowers, I have no problem with insects.

Well...except for one type of insect."
46,talk34,"あっ…！

ボ…ボクの事はいいから
そのトンボを早くツヤに渡してやってくれ！","AHHH!!


Don't w-worry about me. Just hurry up
and get those dragonflies to Gleema!"
47,talk35,…なんとか落ち着いた,I've managed to calm down. Somehow.
48,talk36,"さて…トンボを取って来てくれた
お礼をしなくちゃな
受け取ってくれ","Now then... I must thank you for
catching those dragonflies.

Here, take this."
49,talk37,"ボクは…だいたいの虫は大丈夫なんだが
トンボだけはダメなんだ
あの目で見つめられてると思うと…な","I'm fine with most insects. The only ones
I simply can't stand are dragonflies.

When I think about them looking at me
with those evil eyes... *shudder*"
50,talk38,"なるほど ボクがトンボ嫌いだから
ツヤは気を遣って言わなかったのか…
しかし誕生日プレゼントなのだ…
仕方ない","I see. So Gleema knows that I despise
dragonflies, and that's why she wouldn't
tell me how much she loves them...
Well, this is her birthday wish...
I didn't have a choice."
51,talk39,"それはそうとトンボはどうした…
逃げたのか？
まぁ無理にとは言わない

どこかでポカポカヤンマ""ヒンヤリヤンマ
ビリビリヤンマを手に入れたら
妹に直接渡してやって欲しい","Enough about that. What about those
dragonflies? Did they get away?

Well, I can't force you to help me.


But when you get your hands on a
warm darner, a cold darner,
and an electric darner...
I'd appreciate it if you could give them
directly to my sister."
52,talk40,"ボ…ボクの所へは
持って来なくていいからな！","You don't need to bring them here
to me. Got it?!"
53,talk41,"ハァ…""散々だった…
気持ちを切り替えよう…","*sigh* That was rough.
OK... I need to take a deep breath."
54,talk42,さて本来の仕事に戻ろう,"Now then, time to get back to work."
55,talk43,ボクに聞きたい事があるんだろう？,"You want to ask me something,
don't you?"
56,talk44,気を付けてな,Take care.
57,talk45,他には？,Anything else?
58,talk46,他に聞きたい事は？,Anything else you want to ask me?
59,talk47,"…おや？そのトンボだが
貴様 もう全部持ってるんじゃないか？","Hey...


You already found them all, didn't you?"
60,talk48,そうか残念だ…,Oh. Too bad.
61,talk49,"今は考え事をしてるんだ…
邪魔しないでくれないか？","I'm thinking about something right now...
Can you please not bother me?"
62,talk50,またな,See ya.
63,talk51,ツヤから聞き出せたか？,Gleema...
64,talk52,"な…なんと
よりによってトンボを見たがってるのか？！
しかもポカポカヤンマ""ヒンヤリヤンマ
ビリビリヤンマの3種類も…
グ グゥ…トンボか…
あの目を思い出しただけでも おぞましい…","No... No way! Of all things, she wants to
see a gross dragonfly?!

A warm darner, a cold darner,
AND an electric darner?
Three different types?!
Ugggh... Anything but dragonflies...
Just thinking about their eyes makes
me feel sick."
