12,talk_00,"ふほぉぉ…長らく狭いつぼみの中に
入っており窮屈であったぞ…
おぬしか…？
ワシを外に出してくれたのは…","Ho ho ho... At last! Free of that tiny
bud after so long! If my arms were
corporeal, they'd have cramped for sure!
And you're the one who set me free, are
you not?"
13,talk_00_01,"ほぉ またおぬしか… 

馬の神であるワシに用があるとすれば
嫌な予感しかせぬが… どれどれ…","It's you again... 


Why have you sought me out? Surely
no ill has befallen your beloved, faithful
steeds... Let me see..."
14,talk_00_1,"わが名はマーロン
この世界に住まう馬たちの神である
ワシを復活させてくれた
お礼をせねばならんな…
どうしてくれようか…","My name is Malanya. 
I am the god who watches over the
horses of this world. 
I suppose you deserve a reward for
setting me free... What shall I do..."
15,talk_00_2,おまえを食べてしまおうか？,Shall I make you my meal?!
16,talk_00_3,"ハッハ冗談である

もし おぬしが大事にしていた馬を
不注意にも死なせてしまったなら
その死んだ馬を復活させてあげるとしよう…

ただし…""面白がって
殺めていた時は……","Hahaha, I only jest...


If a horse you love passes away from
some sort of tragic, fatal accident, it is
within my power to revive that horse...
However... If I detect vile intent behind
the death of your horse..."
17,talk_00_4,容赦せんからなぁ！,You will suffer my wrath!
18,talk_00_5,"冗談である…

どれどれ？","I only jest...
Let me see..."
19,talk_01,"……

…ほぉ馬を大事に扱っているようだ
どの馬も元気そうであるな
馬はトモダチという その心構え
見事である
これからも馬と共に生きるのだぞ","...Hrm! I see you're good with horses.
All seems to be well.

The friendship you established with
a horse really is extraordinary.

Remember that such a friendship is
a two-way road. Horses care for you
as much as you do for them."
20,talk_02,"……

…ほぉおぬしは馬を一頭も
所有していないようだな
馬と共に生きるという選択をしないとは…
だが それも おぬしの自由ではあるな…
馬を所有し""愛馬を失ったとき
また ワシの前に現れるがよい","...Whoa. Do you really not own a single
horse?

I can't imagine going through the world
without a faithful steed to keep me
company... To each their own, I suppose.
In that case, I, the god of horses, can
not do much for you who avoids horses
for some reason.
If you ever do bond with a horse and
then tragedy strikes that proud friend,
you should come see me."
21,talk_02_00,"…

ヌヌ～馬を死なせてしまっているではないか！","...Neigh! A horse, loyal and true, has
fallen during your adventures!"
22,talk_02_01,この場で亡き者にしてやろうか？！,"I could end you, right here
and now!"
23,talk_02_02,"冗談である…
それで馬をよみがえらせたいのか？","I jest, of course...
Shall I bring a companion back to
travel with you once more?"
24,talk_03_00,"そう…馬が死んでしまっても
何もお前の心に響かないというわけか…","I see. Well, if you ever feel something
in your soul that resembles equine
heartbreak...you know where to find me."
25,talk_03_01,許さんぞ！貴様！,To feel so...is unforgivable!
26,talk_03_02,"冗談である…
もし心変わりしたら また来るがよい","I jest... Feel free to return to me
whenever you'd like."
27,talk_04,"ヌヌ～馬を持ちすぎておるようである

この世界では 5頭までしか所持できぬという
決まりがあるのは知っているであろう
他の馬を手放すのか？","Hrm... It seems like you have too many 
horses registered.

You do know you are only allowed to
own five horses in this world, right? It is
a rule that not even I can change...
Would you like to set a horse free?"
28,talk_05,"そうか別れというのは残念な事だ…
どの馬を手放すのだ？","I see. Letting go of something you love
is always so bittersweet...
Which horse would you like to set free?"
29,talk_06,ほぉ～馬を復活させなくていいのだな？,"Huh? So...you sure you don't need to
revive a horse?"
30,talk_07,"ふむ二度と会えなくなるかもしれないぞ？
それでも いいのだな？","Hrm, you understand that you may never
get to see the horse again? You're sure?"
31,talk_08,"ではこの馬は野に放ち…
晴れて自由の身とする事にしよう
案ずるなあやつなら一頭でも
ちゃんと生きていける事であろう","Then I shall free this horse.


No need to worry... They are
strong-willed creatures and more than
capable of surviving on their own."
32,talk_09,それでは あらためて聞くとしよう,Then let me ask you again...
33,talk_09_01,"おぬしが もっとも復活させて欲しいと
思っている馬は どれであるか？",Which horse do you wish to revive?
34,talk_10,さあ おぬしが復活を願う馬はどれであるか？,Select a loyal friend to bring back...
35,talk_11,"ほぉ～この馬は不慮の事故だったようだ
こういう事は馬の世界でも よくある事
案ずるな おぬしが悪くないという事は
この馬が一番知っておる
この馬を復活させるので よいのだな？","Hrm. I can tell that this horse died due to
an unexpected accident. Worry not, this
happens from time to time.
The horse knows that you did not mean
for this to happen. Would you like for me
to revive this horse?"
36,talk_12_00,"ほぉ この馬を復活させたいのだな？

ん？なになに？

おい！この馬 おぬしに殺められたと
言っておるぞ？！ なんというやつ！
また生き返らせて また殺めてなどと
するつもりか？
馬はただの走る道具か？家畜か？
飽きたら ポイか？","So... You would like to revive this horse?
This one, specifically?

I can do that, of course!
But... What is this...

This horse says that YOU killed it! You!
How could you?! Do you plan to revive it
just to kill it again?
Are horses only a tool to you? Do you
treat their noble lives so casually that
you'd use them and throw them away?
If I were a horse right now..."
37,talk_12_01,そんなやつ馬に蹴られて死んでしまえ,I'd kick you in the chest!
38,talk_12_02,"冗談である…
たまたま剣先が当たったのだな？
では この馬を復活させるのでいいのだな？","I...jest.


You accidentally struck the horse, I'm
sure. Would you like to revive this loyal,
temporarily betrayed friend?"
39,talk_13_01,"ほぉこの馬を復活させるのでいいのだな？

なんと！爆発に巻き込まれてしまったのだな
かわいそうに…
…まさかとは思うが
おぬしが殺めたわけではないだろうな？","Hrm... Would you like to revive
this horse?

Oh, goodness! It was caught in an
explosion? Poor soul...

Not to cast suspicion where none is
warranted, but...you didn't kill the horse,
did you?"
40,talk_13_02,"まさかな…
まあ おぬしを信じるとしよう…
それで この馬を復活させたいのだな？","It couldn't be the case.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
Would you like to revive this horse?"
41,talk_14_01,"ほぉ この馬を復活させたいのだな？

なんと この馬 ガーディアンとの戦いで
勇敢な最後を遂げたようだな
主人をかばい主人の足となり
最後の最後まで走り抜けたと言っておる
まこと…感慨ぶかい…

ただ…おまえがもっと
上手にあやつっていたら…","Hrm... You want to revive this horse?


It seems this brave animal spent its last
moments in a fight with a Guardian.
It served its master well. I'm so moved...
Alas, if you had managed to control this
loyal beast with more skill..."
42,talk_14_02,この馬も死なずに すんだのかもな！,I wouldn't have to revive it!
43,talk_14_03,"冗談である…

さぞ勇敢な馬だったのであろう
この馬を復活させるのでいいのだな？","I jest...


This must have been one brave friend.
Would you like to revive it and return
it to your side?"
44,talk_15,"あい わかった！
では この馬を復活させてやるとしよう！","Ah, understood!
Let me bring back this horse!"
45,talk_16_01,"無事復活させることができた！

今度は死なさないように大事にするのだ！
馬はパートナーその事を忘れないように
今度死なせた時は どうなるか…","I was successfully able to bring back 
the horse!

Next time, don't let the horse die!
Horses are your partners. Don't forget 
that.
If you're careless with their lives, 
you may regret it..."
46,talk_16_02,わかってんだろうな？,UNDERSTAND?
47,talk_16_03,"冗談である…
さらばだ","I jest...
For now!"
48,talk_17_01,"ほぉ またおぬしか…

まさか また馬を復活させて欲しいと
いうのではないだろうな？
前は狭いつぼみから出してくれたから
その礼にと思ってやったまでだ…
何度も何度も利用できると思うな","Oh, you again...
You didn't come here to revive a
horse again, did you?
I felt I was in your debt before since you
freed me from that bud and all...but you
didn't think I'd always help out, right?"
49,talk_17_02,バカモノ！,I'm very busy!
50,talk_17_03,"冗談である

まあ おぬしが…
礼儀をわきまえた人間とみなし
あれを持って来れば考えてやらんこともない","I jest.


I feel that there is respect in your
heart... If you can bring me something,
I would consider helping you once more."
51,talk_20,"わしも こう見えて馬の神様だ

やっぱりなんだ… あれだ…
ニンジン… わしも一度しか食べたことのない
ガッツニンジン！

あれをよこすなら考えてやってもいい","I may not look the part, but I am the god
of horses. I need that uh...that thing...

A kind of carrot... One I've only eaten
once in all my many years...
An endura carrot!
That is what I ask of you. Fulfill this
request and I will consider helping you."
52,talk_21,"こちらも それなりに
体力を消耗するのでな…
いやならいいのだぞ？
さあガッツニンジンをよこすのか？","I make it look easy, but it takes a lot of
energy to revive horses. Sometimes I just
need a boost before I undo DEATH!
So are you going to hand over an
endura carrot?"
53,talk_22,"よかろうガッツニンジンも持っているようだ
それでは馬を復活させてやろう","I see you have an endura carrot.
Allow me to revive your horse."
54,talk_23,"なんだ… ガッツニンジンを
持っておらんではないか
人を… いや馬をからかいおって

ガッツニンジンを持って出直してくるがよい","No you don't! I can tell! You don't even
have one endura carrot!
Do you take me for a fool?
Come back when you aren't a liar!"
55,talk_24,"なんだ…おぬし復活できる馬はいないようだぞ
まあ いい心がけではある
今度馬を死なせたらガッツニンジンを
持ってくるがよかろう… さらばだ","Huh. Seems like you don't have a horse
in need of reviving. Well, that was
well-intended all the same.
If your horse ever dies, come back with
an endura carrot... Farewell."
56,talk_25,"ほぉ おぬし…

馬を復活させたいのなら
ガッツニンジンが必要だ…
ガッツニンジンは持ってきたのだろうな？","Huh, you... If you would like to revive
a horse, you will need an endura carrot.

I assume you brought an endura carrot?"
