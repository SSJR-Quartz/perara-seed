6,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_010,"何か光ったような気がしたが
うーむ…錯覚だろうか…","What was that...flash of light?
Perhaps it was my imagination
playing tricks on me."
7,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_020,"石碑が確かに光った…
私の錯覚などではなかったか","Did that stone monument just start
glowing? I suppose that proves
I didn't imagine it the first time."
8,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_030,"1万年もの時間を湛えるこの石碑…
一体何を示すのか…","This stone monument has survived
for 10,000 years. What secrets does
it hold..."
9,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_040,"もしや この光…

訪れた者に反応している？
それは私なのか あるいは……","That light...


Is it a reaction to someone nearby?
Is it me...or is it..."
10,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_First_010,"…ん？ お腰のそれは？

いや初めてお会いする方に
余計な詮索でしたね","Hm? That thing on your waist...


Oh, never mind. I suppose it's none of
my business, especially as this is our
first meeting."
11,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_First_020,"それはそうと旅の者同士…
少しお話でもしませんか？","One thing is clear...we are both travelers.
So, fellow traveler, would you care to
chat a bit?"
12,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_First_030,"古の詩に縁のある場所で お会いした時には
詠って差し上げたいと思います
…おっと いけない","Should we ever meet at a location
mentioned in an ancient song,
I would love to sing for you.
Oh... I almost forgot."
13,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_First_050,"そうなんです
詩は ほぼ完成していたのですが…","Yes. The song is mostly complete.
However..."
14,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_First_060,"残念ながら重要な章を作り終える前に
師匠は この世を去りました
私は その章を紡ぎたいと考え…

彼が残した詩に登場する地を
巡る事にしたのです","My teacher left this world without
finishing the key verses.

I wish to weave the missing pieces
together and finish the song.

That's why I'm roaming the areas
mentioned in the lyrics."
15,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_HeroBallad_001,"…いかがです？
試練に挑みし英傑の章でした","...So? Did the verse move you?
It was written in honor of the
Champion challenging the trial."
16,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_HeroBallad_002,"…いかがでしたか？

各地で英傑たちの事を聞いて回ったおかげで
重要な章の完成が少し見えてきました","...So? Did it move you?


By asking around about the Champions
of each region, I'm starting to piece
together the key verses of the song."
17,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_HeroBallad_003,"…いかがでしたか？

英傑たちの伝説を聞き重ねた事で理解が深まり
重要な章の創作が進みました","...So? Did it move you?


By steeping myself in legends of the
Champions, I'm beginning to form a
deeper understanding of them.
This will prove invaluable in writing
the key verses of the song."
18,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_HeroBallad_004,"…いかがでしたか？

英傑たちを深く理解したことで
もう少しで重要な章が完成しそうです","...So? Did it move you?


By understanding the true natures of
the Champions, I'm closer than ever
to completing those key verses."
19,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_HeroFirst_011,いや やめておきましょう,"Well, never mind my musings."
20,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Relief_001,"そんな事よりも この石碑…
いや驚きました
師匠の未完の詩に出てくる石碑が
今まさに目の前に…","This monument... I must admit
it has taken me by surprise!

My teacher's unfinished song mentions
such monuments, and now one has
appeared before my eyes..."
21,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Relief_010,"そんな事よりも この石碑…
いや驚きました
師匠の未完の詩に出てくる石碑が
今まさに目の前に…","This monument... I must admit
it has taken me by surprise!

My teacher's unfinished song mentions
such monuments, and now one has
appeared before my eyes..."
22,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Relief_011,"そんな事より ほら… ここにもありました
師匠の未完の詩に出てくる石碑が…","Look at that! There's one here too!
One of the monuments mentioned
in my teacher's unfinished song."
23,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Relief_012,"そんな事より ほら… ここにも やはり
師匠の未完の詩に出てくる石碑が…","Look! As expected, there's one here too!
One of the monuments mentioned in
my teacher's unfinished song."
24,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Relief_013,"そんな事より ほら… もうおなじみ
師匠の未完の詩に出てくる石碑です…","Look! I'm sure you already know, but it's
one of the monuments mentioned in
my teacher's unfinished song."
25,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Town_001,"それにしてもゲルドの街の方は親切ですね

族長と護衛の方が英傑にお詳しく
貴重なお話を伺う事ができました","The Gerudo are so accommodating.


Their chief and guard knew much about
the Gerudo Champion. They shared some
wonderful stories with me."
26,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Town_002,"それにしてもゴロンシティの方は
お話好きですね
ユン坊とブルドーという方から
英傑について興味深い話を伺えましたよ","The Gorons are unexpectedly chatty.


Yunobo and Bludo told me some
fascinating stories about the
Goron Champion."
27,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Town_003,"それにしてもゾーラの里の王と王子は
気さくな方々でした
ありがたい事に
英傑の逸話を色々 お聞きする事ができました","The king and prince of Zora's Domain
are so friendly.

They were kind enough to share some
of their cherished memories of the
Zora Champion."
28,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo610_Town_004,"ところで里帰りも兼ねて
リトの村を訪れたのですが…
テバと族長のカーンから
英傑の話を聞けたのは幸いでした","I returned to Rito Village to visit
my hometown. While I was there...

I was lucky enough to have Teba and
the elder, Kaneli, regale me with stories
of the Rito Champion."
29,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_010,"おや？
これはこれは…
風に吹かれて誰にも邪魔されず
物思いに耽るのも一人旅の醍醐味ですよね","Oh? My, my.


For some, the best part of traveling alone
is the freedom to get lost in thought
with only the wind to distract you."
30,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_020,"…あなたと私が この場所で出会うのは
不思議な事ではないかもしれませんね
あなたが思索に耽るにも
私が詩作に挑むにも またとない場所ですので","Perhaps meeting you here was
no coincidence.

This is a perfect spot for you to get lost
in your thoughts, as well as a perfect
spot for me to write a song."
31,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_030,"おやおや…
目的は違えど足の向かう先は同じようですね
もっとも私の場合は
足ではなく翼の向かう先ではありますが…","Well, well. Though our aims are different,
our feet took us to the same destination.

I speak figuratively, of course. I travel
by wing rather than by foot."
32,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_040,"瞑想は終わりましたか？
何か深くお考えのようでしたが…
いやいや このようなお尋ねは
余計なお世話というものでしたね","Are you still adrift in thought?


You seem lost to the whims of your mind.
Oh... Pardon me. I suppose it's none
of my business."
33,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_Grow_001,"足りない章は弟子の私が完成させるべき
改めて そう思いました","I was struck by a realization...that the
missing parts of the song can only be
finished by my teacher's pupil. By me."
34,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_Grow_002,"足りない章を作る自信が
みなぎってきました","I feel much more confident that I can
do those missing lyrics justice."
35,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_Grow_003,"おぼろげながら ではありますが
足りない章の姿が見えてきました","The end result is not quite clear yet...
but I'm beginning to feel a stirring
of inspiration about those verses."
36,Npc_Musician_AoC_HeroXxxx_Demo612_Grow_004,"足りない重要な章…舞台は在りし日の
ハイラル城が相応しいようです","The missing verses of an ancient song...
I think the perfect setting would be
Hyrule Castle in the distant past."
37,Npc_Musician_AoC_Individual_020,"いかがですか？
試練に挑みし英傑の章を お聴きになりますか？","Would you like to hear a verse about
the Champion challenging the trial?"
38,Npc_Musician_AoC_Individual_021,"いかがでしたか？ 
英傑の勇姿が目に浮かびましたか？","How did you like it? Did it help you
visualize the Champion's bravery?"
39,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_000,"おや？ この陸の孤島の如き台地で
旅の方…","Hm? How unexpected to see a traveler
on this solitary plateau."
40,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_010,"実はこの台地にも…勇者について書かれた
古の詩があるのです","Oddly enough, I happen to know of an
ancient song about a brave hero...
on this very plateau."
41,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_011,"まるで""今のこの台地のようにドンヨリと…

いえ失礼いたしました
旅をしていると いろいろありますよね
ちなみに私がここを訪れたのは この台地にも
勇者を詠った古の詩があるからなんです","Much like this plateau, you're looking
a mite dreary.

Oh... I apologize. Perhaps it was not my
place to say as much. I understand
more than most the burden of travel.
As for me, I came to this spot to pursue
an ancient song about a hero at this
very plateau."
42,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_012,"おぉ またお会いしましたね！
おや…""顔色が悪いようですが…","Ah, we meet again! Hm? Not to be rude,
but you don't look so well."
43,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_020,"ここでお会いしたのも何かの縁…

せっかくですから
少しお聴かせいたしましょうか？","I can't shake the feeling that we were
destined to meet here.

In any case, would you like to
hear my song?"
44,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_Near_01,ブロロロロ…?,"Rumble, rumble..."
45,Npc_Musician_AoC_One_Near_02,ドンヨリとした空…,What a doleful sky...
46,Obj_BlowSword_010,武器ポーチがいっぱいだ…,Your weapon stash is full...
