真似してみたんデスケド…
初対面にしては飛ばしすぎってな感じデスカ？","...How was that? I figured I'd give an
impression of Hateno Ancient Tech Lab's
director, Purah, a shot.
Maybe it was a bit much for the first time
meeting you, though?"

リンクさんあそこ行ってみてクダサイ
言うなれバドクロ池の左目デス","I'm an amateur scholar of ancient history.
To be honest...I've been focusing a lot of
my research on shrines.
...Oh, that reminds me! Link, there's
somewhere you need to go. Umm...
The left eye of Skull Lake!"
30,talk21,まだ寝ないデスダイジョブ,"I'm not going to sleep yet.

リンクさんの動き ビンビン感じてマシた
……

嘘デス

さては だまされマシたね？

しかし リンクさんが何も言わないってこたァ
よほど辛い目に遭ったと お見受けしマス
こうして報告に来てくれたのはサンキューですが
お礼は無いのデス
研究所は いつもカツカツなんデ
そこんトコ よろぴく","So you went to the left eye
of Skull Lake?

...


Oh, you don't have to tell me anything.
My magical Sheikah nose implant gives
me a supernatural sense of smell.
Just one sniff tells me everything you did
yesterday and what you ate for dinner
last night.
...


Just kidding.


But judging by your dormant sense of
humor, I'm guessing things didn't go as
smoothly as you had hoped.
In any case, thanks for the report. I wish
I could give you a reward, but we're
short on funding as it is.
That's life in Hyrule for ya!"
38,talk29,"リンクさんドクロ池の左目に
行ってみてクダサイ","Link, check out the left eye of Skull Lake."
39,talk30,"あそこに祠あンの分かってるっちゅーのに
途中ハード過ぎて行けないのデス！
ちなみにドクロ池の左目は標高の高い方デス
右目は低いから違うのヨ","I know there's a shrine there, but
it's a challenge to get to it...

The left eye of Skull Lake is higher up.
The right one is lower down. If you run
into Kilton, you're on the wrong eye!"
40,talk31,"リンクさんドクロ池の左目
行ってくれて サンキューでした
でも お礼は無いのデス
研究所 いつもカツカツだから よろぴく！","Link, thanks for investigating the left eye
of Skull Lake.

I'm afraid I have no reward for you...
The laboratory is woefully underfunded,
so I can't afford to pay you. Sorry."
41,talk32,"デスカー…

見かけたら仲良くしてあげてクダサイね","Really... Well, if you see him, be nice to
him, OK?"
42,talk33,"オゥ！それはそれは
お世話になっております！
しかし如何せん
グラネットは まだまだ修行中の身
防具の勉強が終わったら
ここの研究を継いでもらう予定デス","Ooh! Well that's good to hear!


Granté is still a...work in progress.


Once he's done studying armor, I'm
hoping to convince him to take over
my research."
43,talk34,"アナタは誰？

ロベリーのお知り合いじゃないと
いろいろ企業秘密デスから喋れないデス","Who are you?!


Unless you're an acquaintance of
Robbie's, I can't talk to you.
Trade secrets, ya know."
44,talk35,"うーん怪しい お人…

ロベリーの お知り合いなら
それを彼に証明してくだサイ","Hmm, you're pretty suspicious...


If you ARE an acquaintance of Robbie's,
you'll have to prove it to him."
