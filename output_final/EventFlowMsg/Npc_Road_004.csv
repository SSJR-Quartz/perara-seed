ボクはいつだって耳の長い相棒といっしょだぜ
それはそれとして…","I'm hoping to do a lot of business at
Dueling Peaks Stable... Me and my buddy
came all the way from Hateno Village!
...Huh? Whaddaya mean, \""what buddy?\""
You got donkey blindness or something?
He's right here!"
51,MSG_Futa_00_1,やっと双子馬宿に着きましたっと,Finally arrived at Dueling Peaks Stable...
52,MSG_Futa_01,"ボクのロバが うらやましい？
急ぐ旅なら馬だけど ボクにはロバがぴったりさ
馬力とはちがう ロバ力っていうのがあって
それは のんびりしつづける力なんだけど
まあ それはいいとして…","Feeling a little donkey envy, huh? Horses
are faster, sure, but donkeys are more
my style.
People talk about horsepower, but they
forget about donkeypower. That's the
power to stay chill and be good buds.
But that's neither here nor there."
53,MSG_Futa_01_1,"馬力ならぬロバ力ってのは
のんびりしつづける力のことさ
それは いいとして…","Let's see... I already talked about
donkeypower..."
54,MSG_Futa_02,"この先の橋を越えればカカリコ村だけど…

あそこも野菜を育てているから
ボクの商品は たいして売れないんだ…","Kakariko Village is just beyond that
bridge up ahead...

But they raise their own vegetables
there, so they don't buy much of
anything from me..."
55,MSG_Futa_02_1,"カカリコ村では
ボクの商品は あまり売れないからさ","Yeah, I just can't seem to sell anything in
Kakariko Village. So...yeah."
56,MSG_Futa_03,"…ちょっと聞いた話なんだけどさ

ヤギのバターと…""タバンタ小麦と…
あと何と何だったっけ…
とにかく材料を組み合わせると
すごく おいしい料理ができるんだってさ
だからってわけじゃないけど…","...This is just something I heard, but...If you take goat butter...and 
Tabantha wheat and...
Wait, what was the other thing...
Anyway, you combine all that stuff,
and apparently it comes out real, real
yummy.
I mean, I like it. I'm not saying you have
to give it a try or anything."
57,MSG_Futa_03_1,"ヤギのバターとタバンタ小麦と何かと何か…
おいしい料理のコツは素材の組み合わせだよ
だからってわけじゃないけど…","If you want to make something really
delicious, whip up some goat butter and
Tabantha wheat!
I mean, not that you HAVE to..."
58,MSG_Futa_04,"ほんとハテノ村の食材は新鮮さが違うから
行商する方も気合が入っちゃうよ！
というわけで早速だけど…","The foodstuffs you get in Hateno Village
are way fresher than anywhere else.
The vendors there know it, too!
And on that note..."
59,MSG_Futa_04_1,ハテノ村の食材は必要ないかな？,"Do you need any ingredients from
Hateno Village?"
60,Near00,まだ眠い…,I'm not quite awake yet...
61,Near01,えーっと…,Um... Uh...
62,Near02,ロバくん…,My donkey...
63,Near03,ふぁあ眠い…,Yaaaaawn... So sleepy...
64,Near04,やっぱり降ってきた…,Rain! Typical...
65,Rest_00,"売れる日もありゃ売れない日もある
だけどボクにはロバがいる
今のボクの詩に
誰か曲をつけてくれないかな…","Sales pick up, and sales slow down,
but I know my donkey will stick around.

I wonder if I can find someone to set
my poem to music..."
66,Rest_01,"やまない雨はないっていうけど
これが史上初の やまない雨だったりして…","They say no rain's so bad it never lets 
up, but they also say there's a first time
for everything..."
67,Rest_02,"雨は雨で きらいじゃないんだ
だって心置きなくのんびりできるからね","I don't mind the rain, really. It gives you
a good excuse to stay put for a while."
68,RetMSG_Futa_00,"ハテノ村で野菜を仕入れ双子馬宿で売って…
そのルピーで肉を買って帰る…
ボクの仕事が ハテノ村のみんなのお腹を
いっぱいにしてるってことなのかな
そういえばキミ…腹ペコだったりしない？","I grow vegetables in Hateno Village, sell
'em at Dueling Peaks Stable...then I use
the money to buy meat and head back.
So I guess my job is to make sure folks in
Hateno Village have full bellies?

By the by...how's your belly?"
69,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,"ハテノ村の野菜を双子馬宿で売り肉を買い帰る
それがボクの仕事さ！てなわけで…","I sell vegetables I grow in Hateno Village
at Dueling Peaks Stable, then I buy meat
and head back. And on that note..."
70,RetMSG_Futa_01,"ハテノ村で仕入れた
バターと ミルクと タマゴはいかが？
おいしい料理が作れるよ
ボクの仕入れは まちがいないからね","You should try Hateno Village's signature
dish. Get some goat butter, eggs, milk—
cook 'em all up. Makes a nice meal!"
71,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,ヤギのバターやその他ハテノ村の特産品だよー,"I've got goat butter and other specialties
from Hateno Village."
72,RetMSG_Futa_02,"わっ？！

ああ…人か…よかった…
驚かせてごめんよ
ちょっと前にシェーラ湖の向こうで
動く木のオバケを見て臆病になってたんだよね
人とわかれば商売商売","Whoa there!


Oh...it's just a normal person... What a
relief! Sorry for freaking out like that.

A little while back, just on the other side
of Lake Siela, I got spooked bad by this
weird tree ghost, so I'm a little jumpy.
Anyway, seeing as how you're a nice,
normal person and not a ghost, how
about we do some business?"
73,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"シェーラ湖の向こうの木…
目の錯覚かなぁ動いた気がしたんだけど
まぁ それは置いておいて商売商売","Take a look at that tree on the other side
of Lake Siela... Did it just move, or are
my eyes playing tricks on me?
Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
It's time to get down to business."
74,RetMSG_Futa_03,"もう少しでハテノ村だよ
ボクの故郷さ
新鮮な野菜と あったかい村人と
妙な研究所…これが村の三大名物かな
さてところで…","You're almost at my hometown,
Hateno Village!

They've got the freshest vegetables, the
friendliest village folk, and a mysterious
laboratory...
Those are pretty much the village's
three main tourist attractions. Anyway,
speaking of vegetables..."
75,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"もう少しで ボクの故郷のハテノ村！
到着前に ひと商売いいかな？","Pretty soon, I'll head back to my
hometown, Hateno Village! Care to do
a little business before I go?"
76,RetMSG_Futa_04,"ああ久々の我が故郷…
のんびりしたいけど そうもいかないんだ
採れたての野菜を相棒に積んで
新鮮なうちに双子馬宿へ売りに行くのさ
だけどその前にキミ…","Ah, it's been a good, long while since I
was back in my hometown... I'd love to
just kick back, but I can't.
I gotta load up my buddy with vegetables
an' get 'em over to Dueling Peaks Stable,
so I can sell 'em while they're fresh.
But first...let's talk business."
77,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"ハテノ村に着いても双子馬宿へとんぼ返りさ
その前に…","Soon as I arrive at Hateno Village,
I have to turn around and head back
to Dueling Peaks Stable. But first..."
78,SavedLv1_00,"ああ怖かった～
助けてくれてありがとうね ほんとに…","Wow, that was scary!
Thanks for saving me."
79,SavedLv1_01,"最初見たとき たぶん強いんだろうなって…
思った通りで助かったよ","When I first got a look at you I was like,
I bet he's strong... And I was right!"
80,SavedLv2_00,"キミがいなかったら ボクはどうなってた？
想像するのも怖い…ほんとありがとうね","What would have even happened to me
if you hadn't come along? I don't want
to think about it...
Thank you, really."
81,SavedLv2_01,"キミはもしかして名のある剣士？
そう思いたくなるほど ほんと強い！","Say, are you some famous swordsman
or something? Because if you're not,
you should be!"
82,SavedLv3_00,キミがいなかったら ボクは今ごろあの世です！,"I would definitely be dead if you hadn't
come along!"
83,SavedLv3_01,"ああ！生きてるって すばらしい！
命の恩人であるキミに感謝のしるしを！","Oh, wow! It is SO great to be not dead
right now! I owe you my life! I have to
give you something in return!"
84,Talk01,"何か買ってくれると ありがたいんだけど
とりあえず品物を見るだけでも…","I'd love it if you bought something, but,
I mean, I'm happy just to show you what
I've got for sale. The rest is up to you!"
85,Talk02,えっと… もういいのかな？,Um... Are you ready?
86,Thanks00,せめてお礼させてね,"You deserve a reward. Here, take this."
