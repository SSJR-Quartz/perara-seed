Great Deku Tree's stomach, you know.
Try not to think too hard about it.
We all decided to open shops in
preparation for your visit, so the Great
Deku Tree let us set up shop here.
But you're a lot bigger than us, so it
probably feels a little cramped for you.

Anyway, take your time and enjoy
shopping!"
