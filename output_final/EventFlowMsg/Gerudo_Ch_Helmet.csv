8,Talk00,"待て！ それは我が国の宝雷鳴の兜！

いくらお前と言えども
気安く触れることは…","Halt! That is the treasure of the
Gerudo, the Thunder Helm!

You may be held in high esteem, but this

your hands on the pride of our people."
9,Talk01,まあ落ち着けビューラ,"Becalm yourself, Buliara."
10,Talk02,"そうか… しかしいくらお前が恩人でも
これだけはくれてやることはできんのだ
……だが
お前が立ち向かおうとしている相手は
ウルボザ様の敵…

お前が心から望むなら
貸してやらんこともないぞ…","I see... And yet, despite the great debt
we owe you, I cannot just give such a
precious thing to you.
...But you ARE up against the enemy of
Lady Urbosa...

And if you truly desire it, then perhaps
I can lend it to you..."

treasure...

If you want to lay hands on it, you must
show us you are serious and come back."
13,Talk05,"雷鳴の兜を身につけ お前と共に戦った時
名前を呼ばれた気がしたんだ
ルージュとな…

ふふっ…
この名前で呼ばれたのは久々よ
あの力強く温かく包みこむような声の主は
ウルボザ様だったのかもしれないな…","When I wore the Thunder Helm and
fought along your side, I thought I heard
a name called out on the wind. Riju...
Heh... I hadn't been called by that name
in a while. That strong, warm voice...
It must have belonged to Urbosa..."
14,Talk06,"お前の働きはわらわの耳にも入っておるぞ
民に笑顔を取り戻してくれたようだな…
長として改めて礼を言わせてもらう

サークサーク

お前は我らゲルド族の友だ！

友の危機を救えるのであれば
喜んで神器を預けようぞ","I have heard of your recent actions.
You have returned smiles to the faces of
my people...
On behalf of all Gerudo, I must offer you
my heartfelt thanks.

Sarqso.


You are, from this moment on, a true
friend of the Gerudo!

And if it can help a true friend in need,
we will gladly lend you this sacred

誰よりも使いこなしてくれると信じているぞ","I know that you, more than any other,

its fullest potential...
I believe you can unlock the power of
Urbosa that lies within."
16,Talk08,"お前の力は確かなものだ…
しかし力だけでは民は救えぬぞ","We already know that you are powerful.
But you can't solve all of my people's
problems with power alone."

18,Talk10,お前… この兜がほしいのか？,You...desire this helm?
19,Talk11,"この雷鳴の兜がそんなに気になるか？

まぁ そうだろうな… これはウルボザ様の力を
受け継いだ特別な兜
しかし いくらお前が恩人でも
これだけは くれてやることはできんのだ
……だが
立ち向かうべき相手は同じ…
お前が心から望むなら
貸してやってもよいが…","You want this Thunder Helm that badly?
I bet you do. This special helm still holds
some of Urbosa's power.
But no matter how much we may be
indebted to you, I can't just give it away.

...And yet, you are setting off to carry
the fight to the enemy of Urbosa...

So if you truly desire it, then perhaps I
can lend it to you..."

そうすれば わらわはお前をゲルド族の友と認め
この兜を預けようぞ","This Thunder Helm still holds some of
Urbosa's power.

If you want to wield that power, then you
must address the concerns of my people
and bring a resolute peace to our town.
Then you will be acknowledged as a
friend of the Gerudo, and only then will I
lend the helm to you."

まぁ いいではないか
ビューラ
たまには名を呼ばれるのも
悪くないものよ","Hm hm hm...


Let it go, Buliara.


Being called by my name every once in a 
while isn't so bad."
23,Talk16,"我が国にはウルボザ様がついておられる
この平穏守っていかねばの","Lady Urbosa smiles upon us once more.
I must protect our fragile peace."
24,Talk17,"その宝箱に入っているのは
ウルボザ様がお使いになった珠玉の武具だ","Within those treasure chests are
precious armaments once used by
Lady Urbosa herself."
25,Talk18,"雷鳴の兜には劣るかもしれんが
なかなか手に入らん貴重なものだ
ウルボザ様の友であった お前が持つのが
一番良いであろう
遠慮はいらん
手に取ってみてくれ","They may pale in comparison to the
Thunder Helm, but they are very
valuable and not easy to come by.
Since you were a friend to Lady Urbosa,
it would be best for you to have them.

Do not hesitate—take them in
your hands."
26,Talk19,"我が国にはウルボザ様がついておられる

そこにある雷鳴の兜と共に
この平穏守っていかねばの","Lady Urbosa smiles upon us once more.
I must protect our fragile peace and the
Thunder Helm that rests here."
