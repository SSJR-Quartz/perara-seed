5,talk13,"主が その手に取り戻した剣…
マスターソードは真の輝きを秘めておる
その真の力を解き放つ試練…

挑むならば その台座に マスターソードを
挿し戻すのだ","That sword you have reunited with...
the Master Sword...it has yet to realize
its true splendor.
The trial that will awaken its true power...


If you wish to rise to the challenge,
place the Master Sword in its pedestal."
6,talk14,"今の主が振るうマスターソードは
以前よりも威力を増しておるはずだ
更なる強き力を求め
剣の試しに再び挑むのであれば…
もう一度その台座に マスターソードを
挿し戻すのだぞ","The Master Sword you wield is now
more powerful than before.

If you desire still more power and
wish to retry the blade's test...

once again place the Master Sword
in its pedestal."
7,talk15,"マスターソードの力を余さず使いこなせる
肉体と精神力を主は手に入れた…
だが過信は禁物じゃぞ

無駄に振り回せば傷付き いずれ使えなくなり
剣の回復を待たねばならぬのは今迄と同じ
ガノンを討つのなら その剣にのみ頼るは危険
万全を期し神獣を解放しておくことも考えよ…
あの娘…姫巫女の笑顔
わしも今一度見てみたいものよ…","Now your body, mind, and soul are
ready to wield the Master Sword at
its full potential.
But do not let your guard down.


Just as before, if you use your sword to
excess, it will run out of energy and
become unusable until it recovers.
It would be reckless to rely only on your
blade when facing Ganon. 

Prepare for the worst, and consider
freeing the Divine Beasts before
confronting your fate.
Her smile... The princess's sweet smile...
How I would love to see it once more..."

That blade is more than a tool. It is your
