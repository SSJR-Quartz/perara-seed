10,Atacked00,"おい…魔物はまだいるみたいだな
崖の上を進んだ方が安全かな？","Listen up. I think we've still got a bit of a
monster problem. Maybe it'd be safer if
we traveled up higher, along the cliff?"
11,Atacked01,"山登りで鍛えた俺だけど
魔物とやりあうのは話が別だ","Mountain climbing really toughened me
up, back when I was a lad. But fighting
monsters? That's a whole nother story."
12,Com_Talk_00,とりあえず見せてみなよ,Well? Show me what you got.
13,Com_Talk_01,"なら
ルピーで買うけど いいか？","Yeah, I'll buy that. I'll give you... How's

20,Com_Talk_05b,いろいろ持ってるんだろ？買い取るぜ,"Whatever you've got, I'll buy it. I ain't
too discriminatin' when it comes to
stocking up."
21,Com_Talk_05c,持っててもしかたないもの買い取るぜ,"I'll buy anything you've got, whatever it
is. If you don't want it, I'm sure I can
find someone who does."
22,Com_Talk_05d,じゃんじゃん買い取るぜ,"As long as you're sellin', I'm buyin'."
23,Com_Talk_06,どれを買うんだ？,What are you fixin' to buy?
24,Com_Talk_07,すまんが それは品切れだ,"Sorry, but I sold you my last one."
25,Com_Talk_08,言いにくいが…ルピーが足りないみたいだ,"I hate to tell you this, kiddo, but...it looks
like you don't have enough rupees."
26,Com_Talk_09,"ポーチがいっぱいになってる
売るなり捨てるなりして空きをつくりなよ","Your inventory's full. Hard to give you
anything if you don't make a little space."
27,Com_Talk_10,を買うんだな？,"You want to buy that

34,Com_Talk_14,"を個で…
ルピーになるけど いいか？","It's gonna be  rupees, all right?"
35,Com_Talk_15,"それはごめん
俺は買い取れない","I'm sorry. I'll buy just about anything,
but I can't buy that from you."
36,Com_Talk_16,"着てる服は脱いでから売ること
これ覚えておくといいぜ","Take your clothes off before you sell
them. That's a good rule to learn. It'll
serve you well in life."
37,Com_Talk_20,"あいにくの天気で気分が沈まないように
取っておきの品を売ってやるぜ","Don't let the weather get you down.

want, I can show you what I'll be
reordering."
45,Com_Talk_56,"をひとつだな？
ルピーだけど いいか？","Just the one? That'll be  rupees.
Does that work for you?"
46,Failed00,"魔物は去ったのか？
今のうちにこの場を離れるぞ！","Is it gone? Did the monster leave? 
Quick, let's get out of here, while
we've got the chance!"
47,Failed01,"悔しいな…
俺があと20歳若かったらなぁ…","Dang it... If I were just twenty years
younger, I'da showed them what's what!"
48,GoodBye00,それじゃあな！,Take care out there.
49,Guardian00,"おい！すぐに逃げるぞ！
ガーディアンに かなうわけがない！","That's it! I'm out of here! There's no way
I'm going toe-to-toe with a Guardian!"
50,MSG_Futa_00,"カカリコ村には行ったことあるか？
うまい食べ物や新品の服が待ってるぜ
もちろん ルピーは必要だけどな","Have you ever been to Kakariko Village?
They've got great food and great clothes,
but it ain't cheap!"
51,MSG_Futa_00_1,"カカリコ村には そこでしか買えない
食べ物や服もあるんだよ","Kakariko Village is a great place if you
like good food and fashion. There are
some rare finds there, if you've got cash."
52,MSG_Futa_01,"おう！若いの！
崖登りに挑んだことはあるか？
この辺りの険しい崖を見ると
登山家の血が騒ぎ出してな…","I got a question for ya, kiddo. Are
you much of a mountain climber?

I was, back when I was your age.
Nothing gets me going like the sight of
a treacherous cliff, daring me to climb it!"
53,MSG_Futa_01_1,"この辺りの険しい崖を見ると
登山家の血が騒ぐんだ","Take a look at these cliffs. So steep, so
treacherous. Back in my day, I wouldn't
have hesitated to climb right up 'em."
54,MSG_Futa_02,"橋の北にあるカカリコ村は近いけど
東のハテノ村までは かなりの道のりだ
精がつくもの…つまり ガンバリ食材が
あったほうがいいな","Kakariko Village is just a short jump to
the north of the bridge, but the road to
Hateno Village, to the east, is very long.
You want my advice, you'd buy stuff that
fills you with vigor, you know? Gives you
the stamina you need.
That's just if you want my advice."
55,MSG_Futa_02_1,"橋の北にあるカカリコ村は近いけど
東のハテノ村までは かなりの道のりだ
ガンバリ食材が あったほうがいいな","Kakariko Village is just a short jump to
the north of the bridge, but the road to
Hateno Village, to the east, is very long.
You want my advice, you'd buy stuff that
fills you with vigor, you know? Gives you
the stamina you need."
56,MSG_Futa_03,"手足の疲れを感じたら ガンバリの食材で
いつでも元気を取り戻せるんだ
旅を続けるのなら この先きっと必要になる
常にいくつか持っていたい食材だな","Whenever you feel your stamina starting
to dip down low, you should chow down
on stamina-boosting foods to fix you up.
If you're intent on running around all
over the place, you'll want to keep some
stamina-boosting ingredients on hand."
57,MSG_Futa_03_1,"手足の疲れには ガンバリの食材が効くんだよ
旅を続けるのなら この先きっと必要になるぜ","Climbing and running are hard work, and
you'll want foods that boost your stamina
on-hand to keep you from tuckering out."
58,MSG_Futa_04,"カカリコ村の服屋のねえちゃんは かわいいけど
俺にとっては高嶺の花だな
その服屋で売ってる忍びスーツは
魔物に見つかりにくくなるけど高値の服だ
どっちも手に入れたいんだけどな","That girl at the Kakariko Village clothes
shop is a real cutie-pie, but she's out of
my reach—like a flower on a high peak.
She has a nice stealth chest guard, but
it costs a pretty penny. Makes it harder
for monsters to find you, she says.
Alas, I'm too old for her, and too poor
for that outfit..."
59,MSG_Futa_04_1,"忍びスーツは そーっと歩けるようになって
魔物にも気づかれにくくなるからさ
今一番ほしい服なんだよ…
まぁ店のねぇちゃんと同じ位高嶺の花だけどよ","The stealth chest guard masks your
movements and makes it hard for
monsters to spot you.
It'd come in real handy when I'm on the
road, but at that price, it's out of my
reach...just like the cutie who sells it."
60,Near00,朝日が眩しい…,I love the morning light...
61,Near01,日差しが眩しい…,It's nice and bright out...
62,Near02,夕日が眩しい…,What a bright sunset...
63,Near03,夜は眠い…,I'm up past my bedtime...
64,Near04,崖は濡れると滑る…,Climbin' is hard in the rain.
65,Rest_00,"兄ちゃんも ひと休みか？
それはいい心がけだ
俺は登山家だから よくわかるが
がんばるだけが冒険じゃない
「がんばるだけ」で思い出したけど
「ガンバリダケ」というキノコは オススメだ
こいつを使った料理を食べると精がつく
いつもより がんばれるようになるんだ","Taking a break, kiddo? Not a bad idea,
that. As a climber myself, I understand
where you're coming from.
It's not always about pushing your
stamina to the limit. But if you DO, I'd
recommend a nice stamella shroom. 
Any food you cook with one of those
baked in will give you a surge of vigor.
Should be just the boost you need!"
66,Rest_01,"お兄ちゃん もしかして雨男か？
俺はごらんの通り山男だ
雨の日の山登りは危険だから
早く晴れてほしいと思ってるんだ","There's some folks who've got what you
might call a connection with the rain.
Follows 'em wherever they go.
Me, I've got a connection to the
mountains. I'd be climbing right now if
the weather didn't make it so dangerous."
67,Rest_02,"しばらくここで雨宿りかなぁ…
なあ兄ちゃん精がつくもの欲しくないか？","I guess I'm stuck until this rain passes...


Hey, kiddo, you want to buy some
ingredients that'll give your stamina
a kick?"
68,RetMSG_Futa_00,"ここいらで いちばん賑わってるのが
ここ双子馬宿だ
俺は若いころ山登りの拠点にしてたんだ","When I was a young lad, I used to use
Dueling Peaks Stable as a base for when
I'd go mountain climbing.
It's the busiest place around these parts."
69,RetMSG_Futa_00_1,"若いころは よくこの双子馬宿を
山登りの拠点にしてたもんだよ","When I was a young lad, I used to use
Dueling Peaks Stable as a base for when
I'd go mountain climbing."
70,RetMSG_Futa_01,"ここなら馬宿まではもうすぐだ
ひと休みするにしても まだ旅は続くんだろ？
精のつくものは持っておくべきかもな
備えあれば憂いなしだ","We're right near the stable. I can see by
that look in your eyes that even if you
rest the night, you won't stay for long.
I know what it's like to hear the sound
of adventure calling your name."
71,RetMSG_Futa_01_1,"馬宿まではもうすぐだな
早くゆっくりしたいよ","We're right near the stable. I can't wait
to rest these old bones."
72,RetMSG_Futa_02,"もしもハテノ村方面をめざしてるなら
橋を渡って東に進めばいい","If you're looking to head toward
Hateno Village, just cross the bridge
and head to the east."
73,RetMSG_Futa_02_1,"ハテノ村方面なら橋を渡って東だぜ
まぁ歩くとなると けっこう距離あるけどな","If you're headed for Hateno Village, it's
over the bridge then to the east. But if
you're going by foot, it's quite a trek."
74,RetMSG_Futa_03,"雨の日の壁のぼりは ベテランの俺でも難しい
無理せず どこかで雨宿りするといいかもな","Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy
day, even for an old hand like me. Best
to just wait out the rain on those days."
75,RetMSG_Futa_03_1,"雨の日は崖に登りにくくなるからな
無理せず どこかで雨宿りするといいぜ","Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy
day. Just find yourself a place to hole
up 'til it passes."
76,RetMSG_Futa_04,"この村の山の中腹に怪しげな泉があるらしいぜ

冒険するなら どんな道のりでも大丈夫なように
壁登り用の食材が必要かもな","I hear tell of a strange fountain about
halfway up the side of the mountain by
this village.
If you're looking for adventure, go seek
it out. And why not bring some food for
the trip, just to cover your bases?"
77,RetMSG_Futa_04_1,"怪しい泉ってのは気になるが
行くなら山に登るくらいの覚悟が必要かもな","I'm real curious about that strange
fountain. If you decide to check it out,
make sure you're prepared for the trip."
78,SavedLv1_00,助かった！ちょっと ヤバかったな！,Whoof! That was dangerous!
79,SavedLv1_01,"おい！""若いの！
大丈夫だったか？","Nice work, kiddo! You weren't half bad!
You didn't get too beat up, did you?"
80,SavedLv2_00,見かけによらず強いんだな,"For such a young kid, you're pretty
tough."
81,SavedLv2_01,"兄ちゃんのおかげで助かったよ
ありがとうな","I'd've been monster meat if it weren't
for your help. Thank you."
82,SavedLv3_00,俺の命の恩人よ…,I owe you my life...
83,SavedLv3_01,"兄ちゃん…タダ者じゃないよな？
いや答えなくていい","Wow, kiddo... You're a lot stronger than
you look, aren't you? You don't have to
answer."
84,Talk01,"ところで…旅先で仕入れた商品が ここにある
見るだけならタダだぜ？","I'm selling a few things I've picked up
in my travels. Doesn't cost to look!"
85,Talk02,それで どうする？,Thanks! Need anything else?
86,Thanks00,ほんの気持ちだ受け取ってくれ,"This isn't much, but I want you to have
it. Go on, take it."
