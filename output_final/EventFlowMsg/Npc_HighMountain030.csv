That's close enough. Don't make me call
someone."
32,talk06,"私は今から寝る
また明日声を掛けてくれ","I'm about to turn in for the night.
Come back tomorrow."
33,talk07,"これはまた こんな時に…
酔狂な旅人も居たもんだ","What are you doing here?
You adventurers are crazy."
34,talk08,何がって…,"What do you mean, \""what\""?"
35,talk09,"あの神獣 ヴァ・メドーのせいで
村中ゴタゴタ続きだ","Thanks to Divine Beast Vah Medoh, our
village is under siege! It could bomb us
all at any given moment!"
36,talk10,"私が訓練を積んだ戦士だったら
真っ先にアイツを倒しに行くんだがな…","If I were a properly trained soldier,
I'd go straight at the beast and bring it
down..."

I was talking about you, you know."
38,talk12,"空を飛んでいる
神獣 ヴァ・メドーが目に入らないのか？
アイツのせいで村中がゴタゴタしている","You see Divine Beast Vah Medoh flying
around up there?

The village is in disarray thanks to that
thing."

41,talk15,"ベラが古のリトの詩の後半を知りたいなら
私に聞け と？
アイツ…本当に忘れっぽいんだな

いいだろう…ただし！

前半部分を何も見ずに言えたら
後半を教えてやろう…","So Bedoli told you I would sing you the
last half of the ancient Rito song?

Her memory really is the worst...


I can help you...but there is a catch!


Recite the first half from memory, and I
will teach you the second half."
42,talk16,"詩の後半部分を教えて欲しいか？

だったら前半部分を間違えずに言ってみな","You want me to sing the second half
of the song?

Only if you can recite the first half
without messing it up."
43,talk17,ノリの悪いヤツだな…,That is disappointing.

ようやくこの村にも平和が戻って来た","Now that Divine Beast Vah Medoh has
calmed down, the village is peaceful

thinking about going on vacation."
47,talk22,"…残念不正解だ
前半をしっかり覚えてから また来ればいい","ENNNNNNGH! Wrong!
Come back once you can actually
recite the first half."
48,talk23,"正解""次は？","Correct, and after that?"
49,talk24,"フム""正解だ
次は…","Ah... Right again.
And then?"
50,talk25,"正解""次で最後だ…",Well done. Now for the final line...
51,talk26,"フム…""全問正解だ

この詩の後半部分を教えてやろう","Aha! You got every word right!


Well, a promise is a promise. I'll teach
you the last half of the song."
52,talk27,"しかして心は眠りの中
熱き炎が その魂を目覚めさせん","The heart shines upon a path not whole,
but a warming flame can stir its soul."
53,talk28,"これが古のリトの詩の後半部分だ

聞くたびに意味深な詩だが
独特の響きがあるな","That's the second half of the 
ancient Rito song.

Profound, isn't it?"
54,talk30,"…わざわざ私の所に来たという事は
古のリトの詩を聞きに来たんだろう？","...Don't tell me you came all the way
here just to hear an ancient Rito song."
55,talk31,古のリトの詩が聞きたいのか？,You want to hear the ancient Rito song?
56,talk32,"頼まれると断りたくなるのだが…
まぁ いいだろう","Nothing makes me want to not do 
something more than being asked to do
it on the spot... But sure, why not."
57,talk33,"リトの巨塔の黒き体
日の高き時""真の心の在り処を示す","The pride of the Rito, pillar in the sky,
its heart lights up when the sun is high."
58,talk34,"…これが古のリトの詩の全てだ
相変わらず意味深な内容だな","That's the whole song.
Pretty deep, huh?
Makes you think."
