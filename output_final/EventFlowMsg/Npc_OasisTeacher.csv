この可愛いヴァーイに日頃のお勉強の成果を
見せて差し上げましょう
では…

ステキヴォーイが歩いてきます
アナタ達なら どうする？","OK, everyone!
Let's show our cute observer what we've
been learning in class!
Now then...


You're walking down the street on your
way somewhere, and a handsome voe
you've never met approaches..."
15,talk02,"ハイ！

さりげなく ハンカチーフを落とします！","Oh!


I would wave casually to him but also
keep myself prepared in case he's a
distraction for a bandit ambush!"
16,talk03,"プシャンちゃんは古典派なのね

ハンカチは柄物というより
少しだけレースが付いた上品な物がおススメよ","Excellent thinking, Pasha! That's a
prudent approach to a new situation.

Remember that sometimes voe may look
suspicious but are just being wary due to
the sight of a daunting Gerudo."
17,talk04,"ハイ！

足をくじいたふりをします！","Oh!


I would enthusiastically greet him,
approaching with a smile and with my
hands clearly empty!"
18,talk05,"まぁ ディショーナちゃん
そのあざとさ…
大事なことよね～

その時には ズボンじゃなくて
スカートをはいておくと よりセクシーよ","Wow, Dina, that's a very optimistic
approach to take!

Being overtly friendly is an excellent way
to put the stranger's mind at ease."
19,talk06,"ハイ！

力ずくで仕留めます！","Oh!


I would walk casually toward him and
then strike a fierce blow when he least
suspected it!"
20,talk07,"リッスンちゃん…

それは犯罪よ…","Risa...


That would be a crime..."
21,talk08,"あら…私の恋のＡＢＣレッスンを
受けたいのかしら？
そんなに急がなくても
レッスンは みんなが集合してからよ
急いては事を仕損じる…恋も同じよ","Oh... Are you interested in sitting in on
my class \""Voe and You\""? It may even
teach you a thing or two!
There's no hurry—we won't be starting
until everyone has arrived."
22,talk09,"アナタ…
心に決めた人はいる？","Do you already care deeply for
someone?"
23,talk10,"この子達は まだヴォーイと
触れ合ったこともないの…
運命の人に巡り合った時に
射止められるよう後押しするのが私の役目なの","These young vai have never even met a
voe before.

It's my duty to help prepare them for
what they'll encounter in the world
beyond Gerudo Town, good and bad."
24,talk11,"あら アナタもヴォーイハントのレッスン
受けたいのかしら？
夜は私のお家で お料理教室をやってるの
良かったらおいでなさいな","Oh, are you interested in the classes I
teach to vai before they set off from
Gerudo Town?
I teach a cooking class at my house at
night. If you want, please stop by!"
25,talk12,"あら…私の恋のお料理レッスンを
受けたいのかしら？
ヴォーイを射止めたいなら
一緒にどうかしら…？
と言いたいところなんだけど
今日レッスンしようと思ってた
ハートミルクスープのレシピが
ちょっと思い出せないのよね…","Oh... Would you be interested in my
cooking class?

I'm sure even with what you may already
know from your travels, you'd learn
something in my class!
However, while I'd love to invite you to
join us...

I can't seem to remember the recipe for
the creamy heart soup I was planning to
make for today's lesson."
26,talk13,"ハートミルクスープをマスターすれば
ヴォーイも マスターできるといわれていてね
フレッシュミルクとビリビリフルーツと
ヒンヤリメロンが1つずつ
あとはハート型の野菜が2つ必要なんだけど…

そのハート形の野菜がなんだったのか…
どうしても思い出せないのよね…","They say that a Gerudo who masters
making creamy heart soup can master
almost anything in the world.
I know you need some fresh milk, one
voltfruit, one hydromelon...and
two heart-shaped vegetables...
But I just can't seem to remember...
Grrr, what was that heart-shaped
vegetable?"
27,talk14,"あら私のヴォーイハントのレッスン
受けたいのかしら？
恋のABC教室なら兵舎の中よ
良かったらおいでなさいな","Oh, are you interested in the classes I
teach to vai before they set off from
Gerudo Town?
My \""Voe and You\"" class is in the
barracks. If you'd like, please stop by."
28,talk17,"う～ん

今日のレッスンは
ハートミルクスープにしようと思ってたのに
肝心のレシピが
ちょっと思い出せないのよね…
フレッシュミルクとビリビリフルーツと
ヒンヤリメロンが1つずつ
あとはハート型の野菜が２つあれば
ハートミルクスープが作れるんだけど…
ハート形の野菜って
なんだったかしら…
でも まぁいつか思い出せるでしょう…
良いヴァーイは立ち止まったりはしないの","Hmm...


I was planning on creamy heart soup for
the lesson today, but I'm being a bit
forgetful, it seems.
I know that I need some fresh milk, one
voltfruit, one hydromelon, and two
heart-shaped vegetables...
I just can't recall what the heart-shaped 
vegetable was...

Well, I'm sure it'll come back to me
eventually... Can't afford to lose my
momentum in life!"
29,talk18,"まぁ いつか思い出せるでしょう…
いいヴァーイは立ち止まらないものなの","Well, I'm sure it'll come back to me
eventually... Can't afford to lose my
momentum in life!"

ステキヴァーイになる一歩！

皆さんの日頃の成果を見せて差し上げましょう
では…

ステキヴォーイが倒れています
アナタ達なら どうする？","Attention, everyone! Let's get started!
We can show this cute vai what we've
been learning in class!
Now then...


In your travels, you come upon an
injured voe lying on the ground. What do
you do?"
35,talk25,"ハイ！

すぐに病院に運びます！","Oh!


I immediately lift him up over my
shoulder and carry him to the nearest
person who can treat him!"
36,talk26,"さすがプシャンちゃん
的確な行動ね
ただ… アナタが担いで運んじゃダメよ
ヴォーイはか弱いヴァーイに弱いんだから","That's a very proactive answer, Pasha!


Always be aware that an injured person
may have non-visible injuries before you
move them, though!"
37,talk27,"ハイ！

その場で薬を作り
手当します！","Oh!


I would determine what was the matter
and make a medicine on the spot
to treat him!"
38,talk28,"ヴォーイは手作りのものに弱い…

さすが ディショーナちゃん
ヴォーイ心をおさえてるわね！","Great answer, Dina!


Just be careful that the voe doesn't have
some sort of allergy to the ingredients
in your medicine!"
39,talk29,"ハイ！

誰にも見つからないように
家に連れて帰ります！","Oh!


I would secretly bring him back to my
home, where I could help him gradually
recover! "
40,talk30,"リッスンちゃん…

それも犯罪よ…","Risa...
A sweet sentiment...
But also basically kidnapping."
41,talk31,"昼は恋愛教室
夜は料理教室
やりすぎって周りから言われることもあるけど
恋愛に やりすぎなんてないと思わない？","During the day, it's \""Voe and You.\""
At night it's the cooking classes.

People around me say it's a bit much,
but I say as long as there is something to
learn, why not keep learning?"
42,talk32,"みなさ～ん

どんなリクエストにも笑顔で応えるのが
ステキヴァーイになる一歩！
また この可愛いヴァーイに
皆さんの日頃の成果を見せて差し上げましょう
では…

なんと！ ステキヴォーイが声をかけてきました
アナタ達なら どうする？","Attention, everyone! Let's get started!
We can show this cute vai what we've
been learning in class!
Now then...


You are suddenly approached by a voe
whose attention you've sought, and he
abruptly engages you in conversation."
43,talk33,"ハイ！

悩む振りをしてみます！","Hrm...


I would pretend that I don't know how to
speak his language."
44,talk34,"さすがプシャンちゃん
ジラしは上級テクニックよ
徐々に心を開いてる感じを演技するのは
なかなか難しいから
しっかり練習しておくようにね","That's an interesting approach, Pasha!
You could inspire some curiosity in the
voe by doing that...
Remember: it isn't unrealistic that the
voe may actually speak the language you
pretend to know, too!"
45,talk35,"ハイ！

まずは相手の装備品をチェックします！","Oh!


I would take the up-close opportunity to
determine his social standing based on
the clothes he's wearing!"
46,talk36,"まぁ そこに気が付くなんて
ディショーナちゃん なかなかやるわね
わかりやすいのは装備の中でも装飾品よ
さりげなくチェックするようにね","Ah, good thinking, Dina.


Just remember that sometimes all of
someone's good clothes are dirty, so
they might wear something more casual."
47,talk37,"ハイ！

すぐに婚姻の契りをかわします！","Oh!


I would grab his hand and twist his wrist
until he agreed to marry me!"
48,talk38,"リッスンちゃん…

あとで先生とゆっくり話しましょうか…","Wha... You'd...


Risa... Let's talk after class."
49,talk39,"あら…
アナタも私の恋のレッスンを受けたいの？
私はワーシャよ

昼は恋愛教室
夜は料理教室を開いて
ゲルドのヴァーイ達に
恋のABCを教えてるの
よかったら アナタも一緒にいかが？","Oh... Are you interested in taking my
class \""Voe and You\""?
I'm Ashai.
During the day I teach a class on the
voe of the world, and at night I teach
cooking classes.
Why don't you join us?"
50,talk40,"ふふ…
アナタ ウブな顔してわかってるじゃない","Heehee...
You're wearing such an innocent
expression, but you understand, yeah?"
51,talk41,"あら…
アナタ まだヴォーイ心がわかってないのね
私のレッスン
受けたほうがいいんじゃないかしら？","Oh, dear...
It sounds like you don't yet understand.

Perhaps you should consider taking my
lessons, hm?"
