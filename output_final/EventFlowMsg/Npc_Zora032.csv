17,talk00,"旅のお方質問があるゾラ
ちびっ子スババ団の合言葉を答えるゾラ！
白い雲！澄み渡る青…","I must ask something of you, traveler.
If you know it, speak it now. What is
the Big Bad Bazz Brigade password?
Fluffy white clouds!
Clear blue..."
18,talk01,間違いない！本物のリンク様ゾラ！,"Yes! There is no mistaking it! You are,
indeed, the real Master Link!"
19,talk02,"やはり！この合言葉は
ちびっ子スババ団しか知らないはずゾラ！","I knew it! The only people who know
that password are members of the
Big Bad Bazz Brigade!"
20,talk03,"いやこの合言葉は
ちびっ子スババ団しか知らないはずゾラ！","Nope! The only people who know
that password are members of the
Big Bad Bazz Brigade!"
21,talk04,"それにしても変わらないゾラねぇ…
この100年間 どうしてたゾラ？","That said, you haven't changed at all...
But what have you been doing for the
last 100 years?"
22,talk05,そんなに眠れる訳無いゾラ…,"As though you could sleep for that long.
Hmph."
23,talk06,"訳有りゾラ？
まぁ この100年 いろいろあったゾラね…","Special circumstances, I take it?
Well, I suppose a lot has happened
in the last 100 years."
24,talk07,"ともかくリンク様…今ゾーラの里は
ハイリア人を必要としているゾラ
今すぐ上のドレファン王に会って欲しいゾラ","Anyway... I am glad to see you here,
Master Link. Zora's Domain is in dire
need of a brave Hylian like yourself.
I would ask that you meet with
King Dorephan upstairs.
Right away, please."
25,talk08,どうされたゾラ リンク様？,"What's the matter, Master Link?"
26,talk09,では！,Farewell then!
27,talk10,"ドレファン王なら この上に…

流石に覚えてるゾラ？
ミファー様の父君ゾラよ！","King Dorephan is upstairs.


You surely remember him, yes?
He is Lady Mipha's father!"
28,talk11,"スババだゾラよ

100年前にはリンク様に
よく剣の稽古つけてもらっていたゾラよ？","Me? I am Bazz.


A hundred years ago, you frequently
trained me in the art of the blade.
Remember?"
29,talk12,"しかしかつての鬼軍曹も
今じゃあの通りゾラ…
なんでも ミファー様のために
電気の矢を触る練習だとか
しかし水に生きるゾーラ族には電気はご法度…
限界があると思うゾラ","However, the Demon Sergeant...
Sorry, the FORMER Demon Sergeant...
Well, he is as he ever was.
He is, even now, training to extremes by
poking shock arrows to up his tolerance.
He does so for Lady Mipha's sake.
Electricity is banned for all Zora, and for
good reason. Although he is adamant,
I am sure even he has his limits."
30,talk13,"リンク様…
まさかミファー様の事を お忘れで？
ミファー様は里の者が皆憧れる
ゾーラ族の姫君
そして…覚えてないゾラか？
ミファー様は リンク様の事を…
…

詳しくはドレファン王に聞いてもらうのが
一番かと思うゾラ","Master Link... Do not tell me you have
forgotten Lady Mipha...

Lady Mipha was admired by everyone
in the domain. She was the beloved
princess of the Zora.
But then... Do you really not remember?
Lady Mipha was...

...


Actually, I think it would be best if you
heard this from King Dorephan."
31,talk14,"しかし このお方が シド王子が連れてきたハイリア人なら
話が出来過ぎている…
まさかとは思うが一応確認するゾラ","However, if this person is the Hylian that Prince
Sidon brought, this all sounds too good to be true.

I don't think it's possible, but I'd better ask just to
be sure..."
32,talk15,"いやしかし ハイリア人は100年も生きないゾラ
念のために確認ゾラ…","No, but Hylians don't live more than 100 years...
I'd better ask, just to be sure..."
33,talk16,"そうそうお陰様で私の父…
鬼軍曹セゴンも健在ゾラ","Oh! And thanks to you, my father...
the Demon Sergeant Seggin...
is also in good health."
34,talk17,やはりこの場所が一番落ち着くゾラ…,This really is the most relaxing place...
35,talk18,"里内を巡回中ゾラ
怪しい奴が居ないか…","I am patrolling the domain. I must stay
on the lookout for suspicious activity!"
36,talk19,"あの祠…昔から ずっとあるゾラ
一体誰が作ったゾラ？","That shrine...it has been there forever.
I wonder who in the world made it..."
37,talk20,"ここから広場を見下ろして
怪しい奴が来てないか確認してるゾラ","I am watching the plaza from up here...
I must make sure that no one suspicious
is allowed through."
38,talk21,"あのデカい建造物が見えるゾラ？

あそこにドレファン王は おられるゾラ","Do you see that huge structure there?
That is where King Dorephan is."
39,talk22,"寝所では皆無防備ゾラ…
私がちゃんと見回らないとね","Everyone is defenseless as they rest...
So it is my duty to patrol the area!"
40,talk23,"この辺は リトバン親子に任せてあるので
私が しゃしゃり出るまでもないゾラ","I am leaving the main gate to Rivan and
his daughter...so I don't have to intrude."
41,talk24,"この辺も異常は無いゾラ
いい事ゾラ","Nothing to report over here, either.
That is good news!"
42,talk25,リンク様まだ私に用ゾラ？,"Master Link, do you need me
for something?"
43,talk26,他にも聞きたい事があるゾラ？,Is there anything else you want to ask?
44,talk28,さて リンク様私にご用ゾラ？,"Now then, Master Link... What do you
need from me?"
45,talk29,"ミファー王女そしてシド王子の父君ゾラ

ミファー王女が厄災ガノンにやられて
もう100年…
さぞかし寂しい時を お過ごしの事ゾラ…","He is the father of Princess Mipha and
Prince Sidon.

Princess Mipha fell to Calamity Ganon...
100 years ago.

It has certainly been difficult ever since."
46,talk30,"おかげで メキメキ剣術も上達し
今やゾーラの里の兵隊長ゾラ
リンク様恩に着るゾラ","Thanks to that, I made great progress
with my sword training, and now I am
captain of the Zora's Domain guard!
I am in your debt, Master Link."
47,talk31,"それにしても この青空！
久しぶりに雨が止んだゾラ
まぶしい…
太陽が まぶしすぎるゾラ","Look at this clear sky! The rain has
stopped for the first time in a long while.

It's clear... Almost too clear!"
48,talk32,"リンク様！

神獣 ヴァ・ルッタを止めてくれたのは
100年ぶりに現れた リンク様だったゾラ！","Master Link!


Who would have dreamed that the one to
stop the Divine Beast Vah Ruta...

would be Master Link, who miraculously
reappeared after 100 years!"
49,talk33,"なんか いろいろ起こり過ぎて
もう何がなんゾラやら…","I have been so angry about so much
for so long... I simply do not know
what is what anymore."
50,talk35,"本当は兵隊長の私が行くべきゾラ…
でも電気の矢だけは どうにもならないゾラ","As captain of the guard, that should've
been my responsibility. But shock arrows
are the one thing I just can't handle."
51,talk36,リンク様 ありがとうゾラ！,Master Link! Thank you!
52,talk37,"親父もいい年して ミファー様の仇！
とか…ホントやめて欲しいゾラ","Father is old enough to know better
than to seek revenge for Lady Mipha!
I...I really wish I could stop him."
53,talk38,"ルッタが鎮座したといえども油断は禁物…

以前と同じく里の防衛に務める所存ゾラ","Even though Ruta has been appeased,
I must not let my guard down...

I must continue to serve and defend
this domain as I always have!"
54,talk39,"これはこれは よくぞ参られたゾラ

ゾーラの里は今まさに
あなたのようなハイリア人を探しており…
とにかくまずは この上におわします…

…ん?

このハイリア人…
昔 どこかで見たような気がするゾラ…","Hello, and welcome!


Zora's Domain is currently searching
for a Hylian like you.

That said, this Hylian... I get the feeling I've
seen him before... Perhaps a long time ago..."
55,talk40,思い出したゾラ… このお方は…,Now I remember! This person is...
