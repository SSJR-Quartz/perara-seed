ミファー様！""見ててくだされ！

かつて鬼軍曹と言われた このセゴンめが
今こそ神獣 ヴァ・ルッタを討つ…ゾラッ！","*pant...pant*


Lady Mipha! Watch THIS!


I, Seggin, the aptly named Demon Sergeant,
shall strike down the Divine Beast Vah Ruta!"
11,talk04,"しらばっくれるか！英傑リンク！

お主は ミファー様を
厄災ガノンから守れなかったゾラ！
あれからはや 100年…
ああ ミファー様…おいたわしや…","Playing dumb, eh?! Nice try,
but you cannot fool me,
Champion Link!
You were unable to protect Lady Mipha
from Calamity Ganon!

It has been 100 years since we lost her...
Poor Lady Mipha... How heartbreaking..."
12,talk05,"フン！今更お主の助けなんざ借りんゾラ！

里の鬼軍曹こと このセゴン！
たとえこの身朽ちようとも
ルッタに電気の矢を浴びせ
ミファー様の無念を お晴らしするゾラ！
分かったら今すぐ立ち去られい！","Hmph! There is no way we would ask for
your help now, after all this time and
after all that has happened!
So says I, Seggin, the Demon Sergeant!
Even if this body of mine is destroyed...

I will drown Ruta in shock arrows myself!
And in doing so, Lady Mipha's regrets
shall be alleviated.
If you understand anything of courage,
then get out of my way at once!"
13,talk06,"おのれ ミファー様の仇が
よくもノコノコと…
しかし もう遅いゾラ！

ルッタは このセゴンが討つと
元老院評議会で決まったゾラ！
お主は引っ込んどれゾラ！","You have acted so cold and unconcerned
about the harm that befell Lady Mipha...

But no matter—it is too late now.


I shall be the one to shoot Ruta down.
So it was decided by the Zora council!

Just stay out of my way!"
14,talk07,お主…リンク！,You! Link!
15,talk08,また お主か！,You again?!
16,talk10,"ワシは電気の矢の有無にかかわらず
神獣 ヴァ・ルッタに一人突貫する所存ゾラ！
止めてくれるなよリンク！","Though I lack the shock arrows needed
for the job, I am on my way to take on
the Divine Beast Vah Ruta all by myself!
Do not try to stop me, Link!"
17,talk11,"ハハハハ！
お主に言われたくないゾラ！","Ha ha ha! That is the very last thing
I wish to hear from you!"
18,talk12,"カーーーッ！何を申すか！

かつては戦場に現れるだけで
鬼と恐れられた このセゴン
神獣 ヴァ・ルッタを止めるくらい
赤子の手をひねるも同然…造作もない事ゾラ！","AAAARGH! What did you say?!


I, Seggin, used to strike fear into the
hearts of demons just by setting foot
onto the battlefield!
Stopping the Divine Beast Vah Ruta
will be simpler than taking a fish from
a baby... No trouble at all, I say!"
19,talk13,"しかし今日のワシの運勢は
「怪我に注意」らしい…
しかたないので日を改めるゾラ","Still... According to my fortune today,
I should be cautious of injury.

In light of that, I think it would be for the
best if I call it a day."
20,talk14,"ミファー様の無念を晴らしたいのは山々じゃが
今は就寝の時間…
眠気でワシがやられてしまっては
逆にミファー様を悲しませてしまうゾラ…","I still greatly wish to dispel Lady Mipha's
lingering regrets, but I fear it is time to
retire for a while.
If I were to fall due to lack of sleep,
that would only sadden Lady Mipha
further still..."
21,talk15,ミファー様…このセゴンが…むにゃ…,"Lady Mipha... I, Seggin...
shall avenge you... Zzz..."
22,talk16,"雨が…上がった…

これは もしやシド王子が…","The rain...has stopped.


Could this be Prince Sidon's doing?"

Zzz..."
25,talk19,"お主…リンク！
ミファー様の仇！
…と言いたいところじゃが
まさか お主が神獣を鎮めてくれたとは…
ミファー様の件は残念じゃったが…
お主を恨む事は もうあるまいゾラ","You! Link! I have avenged Lady Mipha!


Actually...I wish I could say that, but it is
not true. To think you of all people would
be the one to appease the Divine Beast...
What happened to Lady Mipha was
unfortunate...but I understand now.
I no longer have reason to despise you."
26,talk20,"リンク…まさかお主が
神獣を鎮めて来るとは
ワシは ミファー様が神獣に飲み込まれた
100年前から お主を恨んでおったが
どうやら お門違いじゃったゾラ…","Link... I never thought you would be the
one to appease the Divine Beast...

Ever since Lady Mipha was swallowed
up by the Divine Beast 100 years ago...
I have hated you with all my heart.
But it would seem my anger
was misplaced."
27,talk21,"リンク…
お主こそは真の英傑…
今までの無礼水に流してくれんゾラか？
ゾーラの里だけに…水でジャブジャブと","Link... You are the true Champion.


Will you please allow my prior rudeness
to wash away with the tide? Such is the
magic of Zora's Domain..."
28,talk22,"ぬ？！ ハイリア人…

すまんがゾーラの里元老院は
ハイリア人を毛嫌いしておるゾラ
長居はされんほうが よいと思うゾラ

…

……","Huh?! A Hylian!


I am sorry, but the Zora's Domain council
does not take kindly to Hylians.

I advise you to not stick around here
for too long.

29,talk23,！！,!!
30,talk24,"お主は まさかリンクッ！
ミファー様が仇ーーッ！
ここで会ったが100年目ゾラ！
このセゴン自らが叩っ斬ってくれる！","You... You're Link! Finally, I can avenge
Lady Mipha!

It has been 100 years since you last
showed your face here! Now I, Seggin,
will cut you down myself!"
31,talk25,なーッ！,HEY!!
32,talk26,"こうなったら お主が責任持って
神獣 ヴァ・ルッタを鎮めるゾラよ！
フン！！","In that case, YOU take the responsibility
of appeasing the Divine Beast Vah Ruta!

Hmph!!"
33,talk28,"電気の矢を触る練習中と
言っとろうゾラが！","I am in the middle of my shock arrow
training. I MUST learn to withstand them!
...Did I not JUST tell you that?!"
34,talk29,"この セゴンを目の前にして その狼藉…
","To commit such violence with the great
Seggin standing right before you..."
35,talk30,"もちろんゾラ！

オヌシは電気の矢を奪いおったゾラ！","Ah, of course!


Because you stole my shock arrow,
that's why!"
36,talk31,誰ゾラ！電気の矢を奪うのは！,Who did it? Who stole my shock arrows?
