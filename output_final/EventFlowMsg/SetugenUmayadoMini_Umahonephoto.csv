7,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_001,"どうや？骨の馬は見つけられた？

北タバンタ雪原や その東にある
ケッタイな遺跡あたりに出るって噂やで","How goes it? Did you find the Stalhorse?


The last I'd heard, it supposedly wanders
around the North Tabantha Snowfield
near the weird ruins to the east."
8,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_002,ちょっと写さしてーな！,"Yup, that picture's all I need!"
9,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_003,"ウチのスクープのために
がんばってな！
骨の馬っていうくらいやから
スタルボコブリンみたいに夜出るらしいで","Well, don't give up! Keep working on this
scoop for me!

A Stalhorse is probably a lot like a
Stalkoblin... I bet it only comes out at
night too!"
10,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_004,"何や？""絵も何も持ってないやん
ま そう簡単には見つからへんか…","What's the deal? You haven't got a
picture or anything... I guess it must be

12,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_006,"情報集めて西から東…
気が付けば こんな北の地に…
骨の馬がおるって聞いたけど
もうアカン！寒うて探しとうないわ！","I've traveled to the east and the west in
my great hunt for information, and now
I find myself here in the freezing north...
I heard there was a Stalhorse in this
area, but I can't take it any longer! It's
too cold to look anymore!"
13,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_007,"おおきに がんばるわ…
一番上の お姉ちゃんやからねぇ","Yeah, thanks. I'll keep at it. I've gotta set
an example, being the oldest sister
and all."
14,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_008,"ピーン！

報酬はもちろんあるで！
絵でもメモでも なんでもええから見せてーな！","Beep-beep!


You just set off Juannelle's intuition
sensors! You're interested in the
Stalhorse too, huh?
I just wanted to see this creepy
Stalhorse monster once with my
own eyes!
If it really does exist, it'd be such
a big scoop!

But... Well, I can handle all kinds of
dangers and hazards, but this cold...
Brrr, I can't stand it!
Can you handle this task for me?
I'll even reward you! All I need is
a picture! Or some notes!"
15,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_009,"ほな また何かあったら
よろしく頼むで～","I hope we get a chance to work together
again in the future!"
16,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_010,"ええ返事や！

北タバンタ雪原あたりで
スタルボコブリンと一緒におったとか…
雪原を ばーーーって行った先の東にある
ケッタイな遺跡の手前あたりで見たって噂や
頼んだで！","Good answer!


There's a rumor that it can be
found with Stalkoblins in the
North Tabantha Snowfield.
Some have reported it aaaaall the way on
the other side of the snow field to the
east, right in front of these bizarre ruins.
Good luck! I'm really counting on you!"
17,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_011,"そうか…しゃあないな…
長女やし人に頼らんとがんばるわ…","Oh, I see... Well, I suppose I should learn
to not rely on others and do it myself.
My younger sisters would be proud!"
18,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_012,"お？あんたやっぱり ウチのお願い
きいてくれる気になったん？
骨の馬の魔物""絵でもメモでも
なんでもええから見せてーな！
もちろん ちゃーんと報酬は用意してるで！","Oh? Did you change your mind and
decide to take on my request after all?
I don't think it'll be too creepy...
The Stalhorse... I don't care whether it's
a picture or a memo—just show me some
proof!"
19,NPC_Umahonephoto001_R_Near,どないしよ…,Hmmm...what'll I do...
