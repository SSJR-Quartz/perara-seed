as the swordsman was enshrined—
right in this village, no less.
It is said that if you overcome his trial,
you will master the secret art of defense.

training, so that I am ready whenever
this trial presents itself to me!"

いくら鍛錬しても
老いには勝てんわい","When I was young, I used to dash
through the village like the wind.

People knew me as the Olkin who never
ran out of breath, never slowed down.

Unfortunately, you can't outrun aging...
no matter how hard you train.
Trust me, I've tried."
51,Talk25,"他にも極めたい技があれば
遠慮なく言うといいでなぁ","If there are any other skills you'd like

それが くやしゅうてのぅ…","It seems...you caught me.


I could never get along with Steen...
no matter how I tried.

Even when we'd go hunting together,
I'd slowly crouch down to get close to
our prey, but he'd just charge in yelling.
\""Offense is kiiing!\""
That's what he'd bellow.
Annoyed the tar outta me.
Needless to say, our prey always ran...
On top of that, he just refuses to sell
my pumpkins in his shop!
But... My, what have I done?
I'm just so mortified..."
54,Talk28,"ほっほっほ ならいいわい

そのぐらい ワシにもわかるでのぅ…","We call those who swear allegiance to
Calamity Ganon the Yiga Clan. They...

Well, let's just say they don't take kindly
to those who would stand against Ganon.

It seems they're active again, ever since
that big earthquake the other day.
