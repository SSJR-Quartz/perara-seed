And now I'm over 130 years old...

The heroine, Gaddison...

And my father, Trello... They have all
aged quite a bit, I'm afraid. But they
are all doing well.

Oops! Sorry for keeping you too long.


You have business in the throne room,

でも残念ながら ミファー様は
100年前厄災ガノンに…","Lady Mipha is the princess of the Zora

Well, 100 years ago...Calamity Ganon..."
