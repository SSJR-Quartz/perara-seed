6,Talk_00,"もてなしたいところなんだけど
今は それどころじゃねぇ感じだよ","I'd like to show you around, but now's
not really a good time."
7,Talk_01,ん…アンタか,Oh... It's you.
8,Talk_02,"ここは俺達 リトの村だが…
あんまり歓迎ムード って感じじゃねぇぜ
詳しい事は中のヤツらに聞いてくれや","This is Rito Village, but...
Well, you could say we're not in a
welcoming mood.
Talk to the folks in the village to hear all
about it."
9,Talk_03,"空のバケモン見たかい？
あれ神獣 ヴァ・メドーって言うらしいぜ
数日前に現れたんだが偵察に行ったヤツが
その神獣 ヴァ・メドーに撃たれちまってな
大昔は村の守り神だったくせに
今は俺達が飛び立つと撃ってくるってよ…","Did you see the beast in the sky?
That's Divine Beast Vah Medoh.

It showed up a while back. The Rito
warriors who flew up to check it out
were shot down.
They say it used to be a divine being that
protected the village, but it doesn't seem
very divine to me."
10,Talk_04,おぅ,Don't let me keep you.
11,Talk_05,"村のてっぺんの神獣 ヴァ・メドー
見に来たんだろ？","Let me guess—you've come to see
Divine Beast Vah Medoh."
12,Talk_07,"逆に言えば ヤツに近づかなきゃ撃たれない
ってのが最近分かってな
つーワケで用があるヤツぁ
みんなこの門から歩いて出入りしてるぜ
全く翼のリト族が情けねぇ話だぜ","Thankfully, the thing only shoots at
anything flying high up above the village.

But still... It is pretty demoralizing for us
Rito to have to fly so low to the ground."
13,Talk_09,"ん？""旅の人かい？",Hmm? Are you a traveler?
14,Talk_10,ん？ こんな夜分に旅の人かい？,Hmm? A traveler at this hour?
15,Talk_11,ん？ こんな中旅の人かい？,Hmm? A traveler in this weather?
16,Talk_14,"この村 こないだまで神獣 ヴァ・メドーっつー
デカいのが飛んでてな
いろいろあって
やっと最近落ちついたところなんだよ","There was this big beast called
Divine Beast Vah Medoh flying above
the village up until a while ago.
But someone took care of it, and things
have finally settled down."
17,Talk_15,"ああ今その神獣 ヴァ・メドーなら
村のてっぺんに停まってるよ
停まってからはピクリとも動いてないぜ","Yeah, Divine Beast Vah Medoh is
perched above the village now. It has not
moved an inch since it stopped there."
18,Talk_16,"しっかし あのデカいのが降りてきた時ゃ
どうなるかと思ったぜ…","I am surprised that rock up there can
support all that weight."
19,Talk_17,この辺は相変わらずだぜ,"Things are the same as always
around here."
20,Talk_19,"テバなら ここから出てったぜ

ってか飛んでったらメドーに撃たれるから
歩いて出てくしかねぇんだけど…
橋の向こうに居るギザンなら
テバがどっち行ったか分かんじゃねぇかな？","If you're looking for Teba, he's not in the
village.

I bet Gesane knows where Teba is.
Gesane is probably patrolling the bridges
to the mainland."
21,Talk_20,"テバなら ここから出てったぜ

橋の向こうのギザンなら
もっと詳しい事知ってんじゃねぇかな？","If you're looking for Teba, he left the
village.

I bet Gesane knows more. He patrols the
bridges into town."
22,Talk_21,他に質問ある？,Any other questions?
