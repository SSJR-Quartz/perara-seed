3,Talk_01,"外のスナザラシは まだ訓練中だから
乗れても降りた途端に逃げたりもするが
この子達は降りても
主の帰りをずっと待っていてくれるんだ
それにスナザラシラリーで使ってるスナザラシも
フラジィ先輩が育てたやつだしね","All the sand seals outside haven't been
trained, which means they'll run
away the moment you dismount.
But these ones—the ones that Frelly
trained—they'll wait patiently for their
master.
All of the sand seals used in the sand-
seal races were trained by Frelly, too."
4,Talk_02,"終わった終わった～！

食料の準備と糞の始末で
気が付いたら いっつもこんな時間だよ
スナザラシは ほんっと良く食べるから

さっき食べたばかりだってのに
餌を置いたら一目散に寄ってくるんだ…
アイツらの腹ん中は
一体どうなってるんだか…","Annnnd done!


What with preparing their meals, cleaning
up after them, and everything else, the
day just seems to fly by!
It never feels like I'm done, either. If I lay
out food, they'll rush over as fast as they
can... Even if I just fed them!
I swear, they have bottomless pits in
place of stomachs..."
5,Talk_03,"今日もバイト頑張らないとな！

スナザラシの世話は大変だけど
一目散に餌に寄ってくる姿がかわいくってね
ついつい やりすぎちゃんだよな…

そのせいで夜には
自分が クタクタになっちゃうんだけど…","All right! I'm gonna do my best at my
part-time job!

It's actually really tough taking care of
the sand seals, but seeing how happy
they are when their food is put out...
Although, I do sometimes put out too
much food...

I'm so exhausted when the day is over."
6,Talk_04,"ここにいるスナザラシは
フラジィ先輩が訓練した子達だから
外にいる訓練中のスナザラシより
スピードは速いし降りても待っていてくれるし
レンタルする価値はあるよ

スナザラシラリーで使ってるスナザラシも
フラジィ先輩が育てたやつだしね","The sand seals here were all trained
by Frelly. They're faster, and they'll wait
for you to return to them.
By comparison, the ones outside who
haven't been trained will just run off the
moment you dismount.
It's definitely worth renting a trained
one! Frelly puts her heart into training
them!
Frelly trained the sand seals used in the
sand-seal races too, of course."
7,Talk_05,"…疲れてるんだ
…今は勘弁してくれよ","I'm so tired...
Please let me rest right now."
8,Talk_06,"スナザラシラリーってのは

スナザラシに乗って コースを走り
速さを競う ゲルド伝統のスポーツだよ
南東門を出て右手の方に行くと
ゲートが見えるから
興味あるなら覗いてみるといい","The sand-seal races are a Gerudo
tradition...

It's pretty simple: you use a sand seal to
race around a course to see who's the
fastest.
Just go out the southeast gate of the
town and head to the right. You'll see
the starting line immediately!
No harm in taking a peek, right?"
9,Talk_07,"それにしても…
最近フラジィ先輩…
しゃべり方がおかしいんだよな…
どうしちゃったんだろ…","This is a bit off topic...
But it seems like Frelly has been talking
a little strangely recently.
I wonder what's gotten into her..."
10,Talk_09,サヴォッタ！,Sav'otta!
11,Talk_10,サヴァーク！,Sav'aaq!
12,Talk_11,サヴァサーバ！,Sav'saaba!
13,Talk_12,"私も早く フラジィ先輩のようになれるよう
頑張らないとな！","I'm gonna work hard so that I can be
like Frelly someday!"
