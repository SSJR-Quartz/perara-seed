ちょっとした危険地帯なんスよね
それでも ゲルド族の子とお近づきになりたくて
砂漠地帯をひた走る俺ッス！","The desert's just monsters and bad
sandstorms through and through. They
call it a wasteland for a reason.
But what else is a man supposed to do
if he wants to meet Gerudo ladies?
Wasteland, here I come!"
69,RetMSG_Gerud_01_3,"砂漠は危険地帯なんスけど
この先にゲルド族の子がいると思うと…","The desert's rough going, no two ways
about it, but what else is a man to do if
he wants to meet Gerudo ladies?"

華やかッスね！
思わず口元が ニンマリしちゃうッス…

ニンマリといえば ニンマリバッタ売ってるッス
…おっと""ガンバリバッタの間違いッス！","Kara Kara Bazaar is brimming with
Gerudo ladies! I get antsy just thinking
about them!
Say, speaking of antsy things, how about
some restless crickets?"

ニンマリが止まらないッス","I get antsy around these Gerudo
knockouts. Restless as a cricket.
Is that a phrase? It is now!"

ゲルドの街に賊が出たって噂を聞いてたから
びっくりしたッスよ～","Wh-who goes there?! Oh...just a Hylian.Someone told me there were thieves in
Gerudo Town, and I've been jumping at
shadows ever since!"

ちょっと警戒してるんッスよ～","I haven't had any peace of mind
since I heard there were thieves in
Gerudo Town."
74,RetMSG_Gerud_04,"今度こそゲルドの街に入って
女の子たちに囲まれて…
いや誤解ッス！
女の子たちに囲まれて商売したいって話ッス！","I'll get into Gerudo Town and cozy up to those
ladies if it's the last thing I do...Hm? Oh, just sales stuff. I mutter so
no one learns my important business
secrets!"

by monsters is to run far, far away!"
80,SavedLv3_00,どうせなら女の子に襲われたいッス！,"If I have to have something pounce on
me, why couldn't it be a lady?!"
81,SavedLv3_01,"魔物チャンよりも…
ゲルド族の女の子のほうが怖いッスよ！","The only thing scarier than monsters...
are those Gerudo ladies!"
82,Talk01,"まっそれはともかく店開き店開き！
ちょっとしたモンッスけどね","The emporium is open! Come one, come
all! All the little bits and bobs you need
to spice up your dishes!"
83,Talk02,…んで他には何か？,"And will that be all for you, or can I
interest you in something else?"
