マキ・ア・ルージュ","          -Diary of Makeela Riju-
\t Chief of the Gerudo"
8,Talk01,"母様は天にのぼり神になった…

そして わらわは今日から
このゲルドの街の長となった
母様が神になったのは
喜ばしいことだとわかっているが
神様ではなく母様として
ずっとわらわの側に いてほしかった","Buliara told me today that Mother has
passed on and gone to a better place...

She said that my mother's death means
I am now the chief of the Gerudo people.

I wish she'd stayed here, though. I don't
see how it can be a better place with
us apart..."
9,Talk02,"族長になってから
街のみんなは前よりも優しくなった
でも みんなの目は
以前よりも不安そうだ
母様…

ルージュは母様のような立派な族長に
なれるのでしょうか…","Ever since I became the chief, the people
in town have been a lot nicer to me.

But if I look carefully, I can still see the
worry in their eyes. It seems more
common than when Mother was chief...
Mother... Will I ever be as great a chief
as you were?"
10,Talk03,"ゲルド砂漠に眠っていたはずの
神獣 ヴァ・ナボリスが突然あらわれた
母様から ナボリスは
ゲルドの民の守り神様だと聞いていたが
本当にそうなのだろうか…
明日調べにいこう","The Divine Beast Vah Naboris, which
supposedly has been sleeping in the
desert, has suddenly woken up.
Mother once told me that Naboris is the
deity of protection for the Gerudo
people, but it doesn't seem that way...
I plan to investigate tomorrow. I have to
find out more..."
11,Talk04,"パトリシアちゃんと共に
ナボリスに近づいてみた
すごい砂嵐と雷だ！

こんなのが街にきたら
ひとたまりもない… 
もどろうと思った時に
パトリシアちゃんが魔物に驚き
ナボリスの方に向って行ってしまった…

わらわの記憶はそこで途切れた…

めざめたらビューラが心配そうに
わらわの顔を のぞきこんでいた","Having investigated Divine Beast Vah
Naboris, I can say that if it came to
Gerudo Town, we'd be helpless.
When I drew close to it, using my
wonderful sand seal Patricia, I was driven
back by a sandstorm and lightning.
I turned Patricia toward home, but a
monster spooked her, and she fled
directly toward Naboris again...
The next thing I remember is Buliara
standing over me, her face full of worry."
12,Talk05,"神獣の調査以降 ビューラは
片時も わらわから離れようとしなくなった
そんな時 この国の宝が
盗まれてしまった
ビューラは自分のせいだと言って聞かないが

わらわが族長として未熟だったのが
一番の原因だ…
皆はそんなことを
一言もいわず宝の捜索にはげんでくれているが
無力な族長だと思われているに違いない…","Ever since I went to investigate the
Divine Beast, Buliara has made a point of
never leaving my side.
Even now, with such a valuable heirloom
stolen by thieves, she refuses to tear
herself away from me for even a moment.
She takes all the blame for the theft,
however. Nothing can change her mind
about being responsible.
Meanwhile, I can't help but feel that the
theft happened because I am not yet
ready to be chief...
The soldiers search tirelessly, trying to
recover the heirloom. No one says a
word about my leadership...
But they must be thinking about how
powerless their chief has proven to be."
13,Talk06,"兵たちの必死の捜索で
宝を盗んだ賊のアジトを突き止めたようだ
しかし賊は かなりの手練れのようで
アジトに近づく事すら できないようだ
雷鳴の兜は目の前だというのに…

母様…
ウルボザ様…
どうか わらわをお導きください","Thanks to the tireless efforts of my
soldiers, we've located the thieves'
hideout.
They definitely aren't common criminals,
though. We haven't been able to get
anywhere close to the place.
To think that the Thunder Helm is right
there, yet we can't take it back...

Mother... Lady Urbosa... Please give me
your guidance..."
14,Talk07,"わらわの願いが届いたようだ

英傑を名乗る者があらわれた
名をリンクというらしい
ビューラはひどく警戒していたが
我が国の宝を賊から奪い返し
ナボリスを大人しくさせた その力に
今ではすっかり信用しているようだ
あの者が ヴォーイだということも
すっかり忘れているようだ
…いや忘れたふりをしているだけか

ふふっ あの堅物のビューラが
ヴォーイに心を許すとはな…","My prayers were answered! One of the
Champions of old has appeared!

Buliara was wary, but he has proven
himself by taking our heirloom back from
the thieves and calming Naboris.
She now seems to trust his abilities.
She even seems to not mind that he
is a voe.
She's so focused and serious. Always by
the book. I'm surprised she's
OK with him."

17,Talk10,"あの者が またやってきた
雷鳴の兜を貸してほしいらしい
すんなり渡してやりたいところだが
あれはこの国の宝
さすがに気軽には渡すことはできなかった…

街のみんなの悩みを解決するなど
少し無理をいってしまったかもしれん…
それにしても あの者が来る前は
わらわは毎日悩んでいたが
最近は毎日が楽しくて仕方がない

いつか共に スナザラシラリーで
手合わせ願いたいものだ…","He has returned to us. It seems he has
need of my family heirloom, the
Thunder Helm.
I want to simply lend it to him without a
thought, but it is incredibly valuable to
myself and our people...
I couldn't just hand it over, so I asked
him to help with the minor problems
plaguing the town...
It's funny... I used to spend a lot of my
time worrying about my people or
my ability to lead...
Now I look forward to each and every
day... I think this hero helped with that.

Maybe one day he and I can compete in
a sand-seal race. I'd enjoy that..."
