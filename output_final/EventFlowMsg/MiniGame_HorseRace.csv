12,Near02,もう寝るか,I need some shut-eye.
13,Near03,雨はいやだな,Why's it always gotta rain?
14,talk00,"やあ旅の人かな
この草原には馬がたくさんいるだろう
ぼくは ここで馬とともに生まれ育ったんだ
だから馬術には自信がある…
馬術の腕を競うのに ぴったりな競技があってね
その競技で ぼくに勝てる人は そうはいないよ
どうだい
ぼくの記録に挑戦してみないか？","You a nomad? S'pose you've already
seen the horses 'round this prairie, then.I grew up taming horses 'round these
parts. I'm confident there's not a rider in
Hyrule better'n me.
And I got just the way to prove it—a li'l
game to test which fella's better in the
saddle. One I almost never lose.
What do you think? You got the grit to
step up and challenge the master?"
15,talk01,"どうだい もう一度
ぼくの記録に挑戦してみないか？",Wanna try to beat my time again?
16,talk02,"じゃあ参加料をいただくよ
20ルピーだ！","Great! There's just the little matter of the
entry fee. That'll be 20 rupees."
17,talk04,さあ頑張ってくれよ！,Good luck!
18,talk05,"そうか残念だね
気が向いたら いつでも来なよ！","I thought you had harder bark on you
than that. Well, you ever change your
mind, come back and see me."
19,talk06,"この草原を ぐるっと一周
障害物を飛び越えながら馬で走るんだ！","Ride your horse around this grassy field
while jumping the obstacles."
20,talk07,どうしたんだい？,Something eating you?
21,talk08,"まだまだだね
もっと馬術の腕を磨くといいよ！","Keep riding until you've got some hearty
saddle sores. Lotta work ahead of you!"
22,talk09,"なかなか速いじゃないか
まだまだ ぼくの記録には届かないけどね！
これ頑張った相棒に
食べさせてあげなよ！","Nice riding, fella! You didn't beat my
time, but I'm impressed all the same.
Here, this is for your hardworking friend."
23,talk10,"まさか ぼくの記録が破られるなんて…
自信失うよ…
約束通り ぼくの自慢の馬装備をあげるよ","Holy smoke, would you look at that?
Never thought I'd see the day...But a man's gotta abide by his word, so
here's that horse gear I promised."
24,talk11,"良い記録だね！
だいぶ腕を上げたじゃないか！
これは約束の馬装備だ！
ぼくの記録を目指して頑張ってくれよ！","Now that's a good run! You get better
every time you ride!Here's that horse gear I promised you.
Keep at it, and maybe someday you'll
be on my level!"
25,talk12,"馬術の腕を磨いて
また挑戦しにきなよ","Brush up on your skills and take another
run at it, all right?"
26,talk13,"ルピーが足りないようだね…
20ルピー用意して また来なよ！","You don't have the dough to race.
Come back when you get 20 rupees!"
27,talk14,もう一回やるかい？,Wanna try again?
28,talk15,"挑戦したかったら
まずは馬に乗ってこないとね！
準備が整ったら 
馬に乗って話しかけてくれよ！","Well shoot, fella. You can't enter a horse
race without a horse to ride!Go mount up and come back to me when
you're serious."
29,talk16,"キミが乗っている その馬
まだ登録が済んでいないようだね
挑戦するのは
この馬宿で登録を済ませてからにしなよ！","That horse you're riding isn't properly
registered yet.Go take care of the paperwork at the
stable counter before you come to
challenge my best time."
30,talk17,"参加費は返せないけど…
いいのかい？","Once you pay the entry fee, you're
locked in, so be real sure first."
31,talk18,"なら早く行きなよ！
そんな余裕ないだろう！",Giddyap and go! Time's a-wasting!
32,talk19,"ならば仕方ない
また挑戦しに来いよ！","Well, that's a plumb shame. Come back
again sometime, fella!"
33,talk20,"どうだい？
挑戦してみるかい？","How about it? You think you got what
it takes?"
34,talk21,"ふふ またきたね
ぼくの記録に挑戦してみる気になったかい？","Hah, I knew you'd be back. Come to
unseat the champion?"
35,talk22,よし ゴールしたな！,You made it!
36,talk23,"馬から降りたら失格だ！
戻ってくるんだ！","You can't finish the race on foot,
you clodhopper!"
37,talk24,"どうした そんなことじゃ
ぼくの記録には到底及ばないよ","Something eating you? You'll need a full
attitude adjustment to beat me!"
38,talk25,"ちょっと時間が かかりすぎだな！
戻ってくるんだ！","Time's up already, fella! Come on back!"
39,talk26,"雨の日に走っても
気持ちよくないだろ！
記録に挑戦したかったら
雨が止んでから来いよ！","I'm in no mood to run the course when
its raining. If you want to beat my time,
come back when the sun's out."
40,talk27,"雨の日は馬に乗っても気持ちよく走れない
はやく止んでくれないかな…","Nothing's worse than a slippery saddle.
Sure hope this rain clears up so I can
get some riding in..."
41,talk28,"悪いな
今日は もう寝るんだ
夜は視界も悪いし良い記録は出ない
記録に挑戦したかったら また明日来いよ","Sorry, I'm all tuckered out. 'Sides which,
it's too dark to see at night. You won't
beat anyone's time that way.
Come back tomorrow, and we'll see if
you can unseat the reigning horse
master then!"
42,talk29,もっと速く…,Faster...
43,talk30,"悪いな今日は もう寝るんだ
用があるなら また明日にしてくれるか","Sorry, I'm hitting the hay. Whatever you
need, it can wait 'til morning."
44,talk31,"馬から降りたら失格さ
これは当然だね","Don't dismount your horse, or you're out
of the running. Not that you need telling,
right?"
45,talk32,"あいかわらず速いね…
自信失うよ…
ゴージャスなくらは君にあげてしまったから
代わりに これをあげるよ","You still don't miss a trick, do you?
I'll have to get up twice as early to put
one over on you.
I already gave you the
extravagant saddle, but you
can have this instead."
46,talk33,"良い記録だね！
だいぶ腕を上げたじゃないか！
ゴージャスな手綱は君にあげてしまったから
代わりに これをあげるよ","Just who taught you to ride?!
You're a firecracker in the saddle, fella!You already got that extravagant bridle,
so here, take this instead."
47,talk34,"良い記録を出したら
ぼくの自慢の馬装備をあげるよ","If you can beat my personal best time,
I'll give you some mighty fine horse gear."
48,talk35,"なかなか速いじゃないか
まだまだ ぼくの記録には届かないけどね！
これ賞品だよ！
また挑戦してくれ！","You might not've beaten my time, fella,
but that wasn't bad. Have a consolation
prize, and try again sometime!"
49,talk36,"悔しいな…
キミの記録 いつか抜き返してみせるよ","I'll admit—I'm feeling lowdown after
all that. But someday I'll be back on
top. You'll see!"
50,talk37,"ぼくの記録は1分15秒
勝てるかな？","My best time's 1 minute 15 seconds.
Think you can beat that?"
51,talk38,タイムは分秒か…,"Your time was :., huh..."
52,talk40,"良い記録を出したら
なにか賞品をあげるよ","Do well...and there may be a nice prize
in it for you."
53,talk41,"馬に乗って行う障害物競争さ！

10個ある障害物を すべて飛び越えて
ゴールまで行く時間を競うんだ！
この競技には高い乗馬技術が必要でね
馬術の腕を磨くには ぴったりなのさ","It's an obstacle course, but on
horseback!There are 10 obstacles to navigate.
Best time wins.If you're not an ace in the saddle when
the game starts, I guarantee you'll be
one by the time it's through!"
54,talk42,さあ競技の説明をするよ！,"All right, hunker down and listen up."
55,talk43,競技の説明は必要かい？,You need a rundown of the rules?
56,talk44,じゃあ さっそく始めようか！,Let's get started! Giddyap!
57,talk45,"障害物は正面からでないと飛びにくいのさ
馬の気持ちを考えることだね","You'll never make it over life's obstacles
without facing them head on. It's the
same with this course. Your poor horse..."
58,talk46,"速く走ればいいってもんじゃないのさ
状況に応じて速度を加減しないとね","You can't plow through everything with a
gallop and some steel nerves. You've got
to adjust your speed to the challenge."
59,talk47,"障害物の前で急に拍車をかけても
馬は反応できないよ！","Your horse may balk when you spur it on
right in front of an obstacle. I would too!"
60,talk48,"障害物は10個ある
すべて飛び越えなければ ゴールはできない","There are 10 obstacles, all told. You
don't get to cross the finish line 'til
you've jumped them all."
61,talk49,"飛び越えたら ここに戻ってこい
そうしたら ゴールだ！","When you clear the last one, ride back
here. Simple, right?"
62,talk50,"競技中に どこへ行くんだ！
戻ってこい！","You can't just abandon the race! You
gotta get back in that saddle!"
63,talk51,ならば仕方ない,"Well, that's a plumb shame."
64,talk52,また挑戦しに来いよ！,"Come back again sometime, fella!"
65,talk53,"キミが乗っているのは馬ではないね
挑戦したかったら馬に乗ってきなよ","See here, fella. This is a HORSE race.
If you want in, you gotta be on a horse.
Not...whatever's happening here."
66,talk54,まずは1分30秒を目指すといいよ,"Why don't you aim for 1 minute
30 seconds first?"
67,talk55,"あいかわらず速いね…
自信失うよ…
約束通り ぼくの自慢の馬装備をあげるよ","Quick as lightning... I know when I'm
beaten. I'll give you that horse gear
I promised."
68,talk56,"この競技の難しいところはね
速く走るだけじゃダメなところなのさ
障害物を飛ぶには ゆっくり走って
馬を正確にコントロールすることが重要なんだ","The difficult part about this is the fact
that you can't just try to recklessly ride
as fast as you can.
In order to clear the obstacles on the
path, you have to be able to control
your horse very well."
69,talk57,"これは なかなか難しい競技だろう？
良い記録を出すには速く走るだけじゃダメさ
障害物を飛ぶには ゆっくり走って
馬を正確にコントロールすることが重要なんだ","Oh! Before you go! Remember that it's
not all about speed. You must control
your horse effectively at all times."
