11,Action5_00,あー疲れた,Ahhh... I'm exhausted.
12,Action5_01,"どうした？
おまえも ひと休みしていくか？",Hello? Are you taking a break?
13,Colony00,"始まりの台地？

人っ子ひとりいないあの場所に何の用だ？
だいたい高い崖をどうやって登るってんだよ","The Great Plateau? 


Why would you possibly need to go to an
abandoned place like that? How would
you even begin to scale that cliff?"
14,Colony01,"まあ あっちだけどよ
魔物だけはそこそこいるから気をつけな","Well, in any case, it's over there.
There are quite a few monsters about,
though. So be careful."
15,GoodBye00,"じゃあな
お互い幸運を祈ろうぜ","See ya. Let's wish each other good luck,
eh? We'll need it!"
16,GoodBye01,なんならここで ひまをつぶしていけよ,Why not kill some time here?
17,Hyrule00,"ハイラル城？！

あんな ガーディアンがウロついてるところ
命がいくつあっても足りないぞ","Hyrule Castle?!


I don't know how many lives you've got,
but in a place with that many Guardians,
I guarantee you it's not enough!"
18,Hyrule01,"ほら向こうの方に見えるだろ…
眺めるだけにしといた方が いいと思うぜ","See that? You can see it in the distance.
Honestly, I think you're better off just
looking at it from here."
19,Kakariko00,カカリコ村なら あっちの方向だ,"Ah, I see. Kakariko Village is that way."
20,Kakariko01,"双子山の向こうに馬宿があるから
そこに着いたら誰かに道を聞くといい","On the other side of the Dueling Peaks,
there's a stable. Stop there and ask
someone for further directions."
21,Near00,世も末だぜ…,The end is here...
22,Near01,♪～～,♪Hm hm hmmmm...♪
23,RunRain00,"ちっ ツイてねえぜ！
話は後だ！",Not now. Talk to me where it's dry!
24,Talk00,"いやな予感には慣れっこだけど
今度のいやな予感は いつにも増して…","I may be somewhat used to seeing bad
omens by now, but that... Well, let's just
say it's badder than most."
25,Talk01_1,"…おまえ
見かけない顔だけど何者だ？
まあ誰だっていいか
ひとり言にも飽き飽きしてたし ちょうどいいや
おまえは地面から生えてきたもの…
見たか？","We're doomed! I mean, don't panic!
Sorry, who are you? Have we met?

Well, doesn't matter who you are, really.
I was getting tired of talking to myself,
so you've come at a good time.
By the by, those strange things that
popped out of the ground...
Did you see them?"
26,Talk01_2,"キノコじゃないぜ塔の話だ

それもどうやら この世界のあちこちで
同じことが起きたらしい","I'm not talking about mushrooms here!
I'm talking about those towers!

They seem to have popped up all over
the place!"
27,Talk01_3,"おかしな話は それだけじゃない
昔からある寂れた祠が急に光り出したんだ
わかるか？
いよいよ世も末ってことさ","And that's not the only strange thing
that's happened. Those long-deserted
shrines suddenly started glowing!
You know what this means, don't you?
The end is here!"
28,Talk02,"まあ そんなこともあって
アレの様子を見てたってわけだ
いきなり動き出しやしないかってね","With all this craziness happening,
I've been keeping an eye on
that thing.
Just to see if it suddenly starts moving,
ya know?"
29,Talk03,"アレっていったらガーディアンのことだろう！
おまえ ハイラルの昔話を知らないのか？","I'm talking about that Guardian,
of course! Haven't you heard the
old stories about Hyrule?"
30,Talk04,"そうだガーディアンだ
昔話で おなじみのアレだ","Yeah, that Guardian is worth watching.
It's just like the ones from those
old stories."
31,Talk05,"あそこにあるのが見えるだろ？
壺をひっくり返したような形のアレだ","See that thing over there? The one
shaped like an overturned urn?
THAT is what I'm talking about."
32,Talk06,"じつはオレ""動き出したアレに見つかって
追いかけ回されたことがあるんだ","Did you know some of them can move?
One of them once chased me down and
tried to kill me!"
33,Talk07,"いや そこにあるのとは別のアレだ

ここから城の方に向かう途中にある森の
手前だったな…
見つかると赤い光が飛んでくるんだぜ？

ああ これでオレもおしまいだって
さすがにあの時は覚悟したね
それでも なんとかギリギリ
森に逃げ込むことができたんだ
え？ オレの運動神経が？

いや そうじゃなくて ツイてただけさ

なんでも ハイラル城の周りには
そんなガーディアンがウヨウヨいるらしい","No, it was a different one.


That one was closer to the castle but
before the forest...

When they spot you, they shoot blue
beams of light at you!

Man, I was so sure that was the end
for me. I was prepared for the worst.

But I somehow managed to escape into
the nearby woods.

You think it was my lightning-fast
reflexes that saved me?

Ha, I wish. Truth is, I just got lucky.


Anyway, I hear Guardians like that still
wander around Hyrule Castle."
34,Talk08,"久しぶりの話し相手に
嫌われちまったかな…","*siiigh* Just when I find someone to
talk to... I wonder what I did to make
him hate me..."
35,Talk09,おまえも気をつけなよ,Be careful.
36,TalkLoop00,"なんでも聞いてみな
話し相手になってやるぜ","Ask me whatever you want! I'm happy to
chat with you awhile."
37,Wander00,"どうした？
おまえも話し相手がほしいのか？","Hello? Are you looking for someone to
chat with too?"
38,Wander01,"見回りだよ見回り
この橋は交通の要所だからな
魔物が橋に棲みつかないように
追っ払ったりとか いろいろ大変なんだよ","Just patrolling. This bridge is an
important route.

I keep really busy making sure monsters
don't nest here by chasing them off the
bridge and stuff."
39,Wander02,どこに行きたいんだ？,Where do you want to go?
40,WanderRain00,どうだ止みそうか？,So... Think the rain will let up soon?
41,Warning00,おい早まるな！,Hey! Don't be rash!
42,Warning01,ちょっと待て！考え直せ！,"Wait a minute! Please, think about what
you're doing!"
43,Warning02,"オレも若いけど
おまえは もっと若い
オレもがんばってるけど
おまえは もっとがんばってくれそうだ
おまえの顔を見ると そんな気がするんだよ
…オレにはね","I'm young, but you're even younger.


I'm trying my best out here, but I get the
feeling you're going to end up trying
even harder in this world.
That's the feeling I get when I look at
your face... But maybe I'm nuts."
44,Warning03,"おまえが この世からいなくなっても
世界は変わらないかもしれない
だが ひとつだけ確実に変わるものがある
それは…
オレの気分だ！

目の前で そんなことをされたら
誰だってショックだろ？","You won't change the world by jumping
carelessly to your doom, don't ya know!

That would only do one thing...
And that's...

Drive me batty!


Seriously! Think of the shock I'd suffer,
seeing something like that!"
45,Warning04,"落ち着いて欄干から下りるんだ
向こう側じゃないぞ こちら側だ","Now calm down and climb off that rail.
And don't climb down THAT way.
Climb down THIS way!"
46,Warning05,"いいか早まるなよ
楽しいことは この先に待ってるんだ","You're fine. Just don't be so careless.
There are too many enjoyable things in
the world to gamble with your life!"
47,WarningClear00,"もう あんな真似するんじゃないぞ
…冷や汗かいたぜ まったく","Man! Don't ever do something like that
again, got it? You almost gave me a
heart attack. Seriously!"
48,WarningClear01,"ふぅ焦ったぜ
大人を からかうもんじゃないぞ","Phew! You had me worried there. 
Don't mess with people like that."
49,WarningClear02,"…オレでよければ
話し相手になってやるぜ","I'll stay here and chat with you for a bit,
if you'd like."
