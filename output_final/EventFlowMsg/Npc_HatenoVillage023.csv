その青い炎はてっきり プルアさんのものだと…","Oh, my, how unusual...


I thought that blue flame was only ever
wielded by Purah..."
10,talk01,"…そういえば最近プルアさんの姿を
見かけませんねぇ
お元気ならば いいのですが…","...Which reminds me, I haven't seen
Purah around here lately.

I hope she's all right..."

13,talk04,はい こんばんは,"Yes, good evenin', indeed."
14,talk05,"さて…

getting ready for bed."
15,talk06,さぁ みんな帰る時間ですよ,It's time for everyone to head home.
16,talk07,明日も早いので もう寝ますね…,"I've got an early mornin' again tomorrow,

19,talk11,あら旅のお方？,Are you some sorta traveler?
20,talk12,はい さようなら,"Yes, good-bye."
21,talk13,"そうですか…
だったら新しく引っ越して来られたのかしら","Oh... You must have moved here pretty
recently then, hm?"
22,talk14,あら それはそれは…,"Well, I'll be..."
23,talk15,"最近は平和になってきたのか
この村も活気づいてきましてね","The village has grown to be quite a lively
place. I suppose that's on account of
things bein' so peaceful in general. "
24,talk16,あらあら せわしない…,"Oh, dear. You must be in a hurry..."
25,talk17,"ええ ええ…そりゃあ もう…

私が子供の頃なんかは この辺一帯
畑ができる状態じゃなくってね…
遠くではハイラル城が城下町ごと全部壊れて
そこにいた人はみな犠牲になったとか…
あの日の出来事は大厄災と呼ばれてますが
あの悲惨さは言葉では伝わらないでしょうねぇ","Oh, yes... When I was a child, this
whole region wasn't in a state fit to be
sown, much less harvested.
Hyrule Castle and Castle Town had
been destroyed, and all the lovely folks
there fell victim to...
Well...back in bygone days, we called it
the Calamity.

But words often fall meaningless when
we try to describe tragic events of
a certain magnitude..."
26,talk18,はいはい旅のお方ですよね？,"Yes, yes, you are a traveler, are you not?"
27,talk19,はいはい,"Yes, yes..."
28,talk20,このばあさんに何か御用ですか？,"And now how could an old lady like me
help you out there?"
29,talk21,"大厄災…

私が生まれた時は全てが終わった後…
焼野原の時代でした
ハテノ村の被害は
まだマシだったと言われとりますが
私が物心付く頃にやっと
自給自足を始められるようになりましたねぇ
被害の中心だったハイラル城とその城下町は
未だに大厄災の禍根を残しておるとか…
私より年上の人なら もっと詳しい事を
知っておられるやも知れませんねぇ…","The Calamity, yes...


I didn't come along until everything was
already over... I was born during the
Age of Burning Fields.
By the time I was old enough to be aware
of it, the plants around Hateno Village
were budding... We were self-sufficient.
Even so, Hyrule Castle and the Castle
Town remain a home ground for the
forces of the Calamity to this very day...
Those who are older than I might know
more about it..."
30,talk22,"ハイラル城とは摩天の孤城にして
このハイラル全土を束ねる中心
盟主ハイラル王と
見目麗しき姫が おったそうです
村々の勇敢なる者は皆そこを目指し
手柄を立て故郷に錦を飾った という事です
その最強を誇るハイラル城が大厄災で潰え
今でも当時の痛ましい姿を留めているとは…","Hyrule Castle was the governing center
of Hyrule, home to the king and the
beautiful princess.
Brave souls from nearby villages would
all set their sights there, do great deeds,
and return home draped in glory.
Hyrule Castle, once strong and proud,
was corrupted by the Calamity...and it's
still in that state today."
31,talk23,"ハイラル城の城下町は
商業にも学術にも秀でた町だったそうな
そうそう…あなた
地図は お持ちですか？
今でも地図の真ん中に描かれる大きな更地…
そこが城下町の跡地といいますからねぇ
当時の城下町の規模たるや
如何ばかりか…","They say that Castle Town was once a
center both for commerce and
knowledge. That reminds me...
Do you have a map?


You should be able to see the ruins of
Castle Town in the center of your map.

Just looking at those ruins now...it really
gives you an idea of the destruction
that went on there."

その青い炎はてっきり""所長さんのものだと…","Oh, how unusual.


That blue flame undoubtedly belongs to
the Director..."

director around here lately. I hope
everything's all right..."
34,talk26,今日は生憎のお天気ですねぇ,"Unfortunate weather we're having today,
isn't it?"
35,talk27,おや？ それが必要かい？,Huh? You need that?
36,talk28,"持って行きなさい
村の者には私から説明しておくから
いっぱい食べるんですよ","Take it. I'll explain to the villagers.
You eat your fill."
37,talk29,他に聞きたい事は ありますか？,Did you wanna hear about anything else?
