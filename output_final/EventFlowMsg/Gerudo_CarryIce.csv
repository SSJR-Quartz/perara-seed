このまま私はここで
朽ち果てるんだ…","I can't take it anymore...


I'm going to rot here..."
10,Npc_GerudoDesert002_F_002,えっ…？,Huh?
11,Npc_GerudoDesert002_F_003,"トビキリの
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイですって？
こうしちゃいられないわ！","Did you say \""best Noble Pursuit ever\""?


Pfft, I am GONE!"
12,Npc_GerudoDesert002_S02_001,気を付けてな！,Be careful!
13,Npc_GerudoDesert003_F_001,"無事に氷を フロスさんに渡せたみたいだな 

私も久々に フロスさんの
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイが飲みたくなったよ","So you were able to get the ice all the
way to Furosa? Excellent.

That reminds me... It's been so long
since I've had a Noble Pursuit like
Furosa makes..."
14,Npc_GerudoDesert003_R_001,"ここは北の雪山から運んだ氷を
保存する氷室だ
貴重な氷だからな
24時間私が管理しているんだ","This is an icehouse used for storing the
ice brought down from the mountains.

Seeing as we live in a desert, it's pretty
important stuff for us Gerudo... So I
manage this place 24 hours a day."
15,Npc_GerudoDesert003_S01_001,"そうか…
フロスさんの頼みとあれば仕方がないな
ではこの氷を持っていくがいい

しかしこの暑さだ わかってると思うが
チンタラ運んでたら溶けてしまうからな
気を付けて フロスさんの元まで運ぶんだぞ","I see... Well, if Furosa wants ice, then
you should bring her some.

You're permitted to take some ice.


You've taken the heat into account,
right? If you move too slowly, the ice will
surely melt.
Furosa has no use for water..."

仕事は… もう終わりだ…

フロスさんの頼みなんで
何とかしてやりたいが
これも規則なんでな","Sorry, but I'm done for the day.


I know... It's a request from Furosa.
Really, I'd like to help, but rules are
rules, and I'm off the clock."
20,Npc_GerudoDesert003_S01_104,"すまんが…

今日は疲れてるんでな
もう寝かせてくれないか？
用があるなら明日聞くよ","Sorry, you're out of luck.


I'm exhausted from work.
Let me get some rest. 

Come back later if you need something."
21,Npc_GerudoDesert003_S02_001,…まさか,...You've got to be kidding me.
22,Npc_GerudoDesert003_S02_002,"だろうな…

氷運びは我らでも失敗することもある

気にしなくていい
もう1つ持っていっていいぞ","Ah, I figured as much...


Even the Gerudo make mistakes
transporting ice, sometimes. Just grab
another block and try again."
23,Npc_GerudoDesert003_S02_101,"砂漠の暑さは お前も知ってるだろう
チンタラ運んでると溶けてしまうぞ","You've walked through the desert...
You know how hot it can get. Don't take
your time, or the ice will melt."

フロスさんの頼みだから仕方ないが
氷は貴重だってことを忘れるなよ","I can't believe it...


OK, I know this is a request from Furosa,
but please remember that ice is precious
around here!"
25,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_002,"ヴァーサーク…

ハイリアのお嬢ちゃんかい？

いくつか知らないが
お嬢ちゃんには ウチはまだ早いようだね
ウチで使ってる氷は特別でね…
違いがわかる年齢になってから また来るんだね","Vasaaq... A Hylian vai, huh...


I can't tell how old you are, but this
place is definitely not for young vai.

Because the drinks we make here are
different from regular drinks. For one,
they have a rare treat in them—ice..."
26,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_004,"ウチの看板商品
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイが欲しいのかい？
すまないが アレを作るには
大量の氷が必要になるんだが
今 ちょうど切らしていてね

それよりも あれは強い酒なんだ

どっちにしてもアンタみたいな
お嬢ちゃんには売れないねぇ""","You want to try our signature
drink, Noble Pursuit?

Unfortunately, I need a huge amount of
ice to make that drink, and I'm fresh out
right now.
Besides, it's a really strong drink. 


Even if I could make it, I wouldn't sell it
to a little vai like you."
27,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_005,"そういえば…
最近 パクトを見ないねぇ…
毎日のように ウチのヴァーイミーツヴォーイを
飲みに来てたんだけどねぇ…
ああ ごめんよ
お嬢ちゃんには関係のない話だったね","I haven't seen Pokki in a while...
She used to come in and order a Noble
Pursuit almost every day...
Ah, sorry. This has nothing to do with
you, little vai."
28,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_006,"まったくあの子は…
ほんと手のかかる子だよ","I was just thinking about how I haven't
seen Pokki lately...

She's such a handful."
29,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_007,"氷室はこの街の北の方にあるんだ

そこにいるアンチェってやつに
事情を話せば氷を分けてもらえるだろうよ
ただ アイツは夜は早くに寝ちまうからね

行くなら明るいうちだよ","The icehouse is located north of
the city.

Anche will be on duty there. Just let her
know what's going on, and she'll
probably part with some ice.
Remember, though... She goes to bed
pretty early.

You'll have to make sure to get there
while it's bright out."
30,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_008,"やっと祠を見つけたってのに…

っぐ…
ノドが乾いて…
う…""動けない…

最後に…
最後に一口…
キンッキンに冷えた
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイが飲みたかったなぁ…","I'd just found the shrine too...


Ugh, my throat... It's so dry...
I can't move a muscle...

If this really is the end...


I wish I could have one last taste...
One sip...

One sip of an ice-cold Noble Pursuit..."
31,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_016,"お嬢ちゃんのおかげで
トビキリのヴァーイミーツヴォーイを作れたよ
悪いけどパクトに伝えてきてくれないかい？
最高のを作って待ってるってね…
なぁに… トビキリの酒があると言えば
アイツのことだ飛んでくるだろうさ","Thanks to you, I was able to make what
might be my best Noble Pursuit ever.

If it's not too much to ask, could you
please go tell Pokki that some of the best
Noble Pursuit is waiting for her here?
What? Trust me on this! Knowing her,
she'll come sprinting back the moment
she hears what you have to say."
32,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_017,"なんだって？

パクトがそんなことに？？

しかし なんとかしてやりたいが
氷がないことには アレは作れないんだよ…
氷室に行けば氷はあるが…
あたしゃ足が悪いし…","What'd you say?


Pokki's collapsed?


Hmm. I want to help her out, but I can't
make a you-know-what without ice.

There's ice at the icehouse, but my legs
aren't in the best shape for hauling ice..."
33,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_018,"最近来ないと思ってたら…

まさかパクトが
そんなことになってるとはねぇ
なんでこんな時に限って
氷を切らしちまうんだか…","I was wondering why I hadn't seen her in
a while. 

I had no idea she was in such a dire
situation.

Why'd I have to run out of ice at a time
like this?"
34,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_019,"本当かい？

そりゃ助かるよ
パクトはウチの上得意だからね
氷室はこの街の北にある

そこにいるアンチェってヤツに
事情を話せば氷を分けてくれるだろうよ
ただ アイツは早くに寝ちまうからね…

行くなら明るいうちだよ","Are you serious? You'll get it?
That'd be a huge help.

Pokki is my best customer, after all.
I wish I could get the ice myself...

Anyway, the icehouse is north of town.


Anche manages it, but I think if you 
explain the situation, she'll let you have
some ice.
You should know that she heads to bed
quite early. 

If you plan to go, you'll need to get there
while it's bright out."
35,Npc_GerudoMilkflost_020,"おっとお嬢ちゃん…

氷をかついで砂漠を越えて…
街まで来させるなんて その細腕には申し訳ない
街と氷室の途中にある遺跡の入り口までなら
あたしでも迎えに行けるから
そこまで氷を持ってきておくれ","Oh, young lady...


Carrying ice all the way through the
desert and then all the way to town?
I can't let that stand.
If you bring the ice to the entrance to
the ruins—between town and the
icehouse—I can take it from there."
36,Npc_oasis025_S02_001,悪いが ここまで氷を持ってきてくれんか？,"I'm sorry, but could you bring the ice
here to me?"
37,Npc_oasis025_S02_002,"おおーい！こっちだよ！
氷はここに持ってきておくれ！","Heeey! Over here! This way!
Bring the ice over here!"
38,Npc_oasis025_S02_101,"おぉ… これは間違いなく氷室の氷

これなら トビキリの
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイを作れるだろうさ
悪いけどパクトに伝えてきてくれないかい？
最高のを作って待ってるってね…
なぁに… トビキリの酒があると言えば
アイツのことだ飛んでくるだろうさ","Whoa. No doubt about it, that's
definitely ice from the icehouse. 

I'll be able to make a Noble Pursuit with
this. It may be the best I've ever made...

I've got one more favor to ask. Could you
go and let Pokki know? Just tell her the
best drink ever is waiting for her...
What? No, of course this will work.
Knowing her, if she hears a delicious
drink is waiting, she'll come running."
39,Npc_oasis025_S02_104,"氷も良い状態だね
サークサーク
これなら トビキリの
ヴァーイミーツヴォーイを作れるだろうさ
悪いけどパクトに伝えてきてくれないかい？
最高のを作って待ってるってね…
なぁに… トビキリの酒があると言えば
アイツのことだ飛んでくるだろうさ","Looks like the ice is in good shape.
Sarqso.

With this, I'll be able to make the
ultimate Noble Pursuit.

Sorry, but could you please let Pokki 
know? Tell her that I made the best one
ever and I've got it waiting for her...
Knowing her, she'll probably come
running when she hears that there's an
amazing drink with her name on it."
40,Npc_oasis025_S02_105,"ん？アンタは…
まあ…""氷さえ届けてくれたら誰だっていいさ","Hm? You're...
Well, whatever... I don't care who you
are, as long as I get my ice."
41,Npc_oasis025_S02_201,"氷はまだのようだね…

アンチェに頼めば氷をもらえるだろう
悪いが頼んだよ","It looks like the ice isn't here yet...


If you ask Anche, she'd probably let you
have some ice. Sorry to ask you again, 
but could you do this for me?"
42,near00,もうダメだ…,I'm done for...
43,near01,こっちだよ…,Over here...
