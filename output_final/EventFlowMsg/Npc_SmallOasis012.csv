4,Talk_000,"あの神獣… なんだか日増しに
こちらに近づいている気がするのよね…
いつになったらゲルドの街に
戻れるのかしら…","That Divine Beast... It feels like it gets a
little bit closer every day.

I wonder how long it will be before I can
get back to Gerudo Town..."
5,Talk_001,"あの神獣さえ現れなければ
とっくにゲルドの街に帰ってるのに…","If only that Divine Beast wasn't around.
I would already be back at 
Gerudo Town..."
6,Talk_006,"神獣のせいでずっとカラカラバザールから
出られなかったから
のどもカラカラよ～","Thanks to that Divine Beast, I'd been
unable to get home for so long that
I'd forgotten my actual address!"
7,Talk_007,"ちょっと！
ここ笑うとこなんだけど？",Hey! This isn't a joke!
8,Talk_008,サヴォッタ…,Sav'otta...

14,Talk_101,"神獣っていうのは外を徘徊している
あの おっきなヤツのことなんだけど…
アレのおかげで砂嵐はヒドイし
近づいたら黒焦げにされるって噂だし…
こわくてゲルドの街に戻れないのよね…","When I say Divine Beast, I'm talking
about that giant thing roaming around
the desert...
It's been kicking up bad sandstorms, and
apparently it'll blast you with lightning if
you get too close!
The thought of getting zapped is
terrifying. I can't risk traveling to
Gerudo Town..."
15,Talk_102,"ここから南西の場所にある
私達 ゲルド族が住む街よ
この辺りでは一番大きな街で
市場もあるし酒場もあるし
朝から晩までにぎわってるの

でも残念ね…

ヴォーイは街に立ち入ってはいけない掟なの
アナタは入れないわね…","There's a town to the southwest, made
up almost entirely of Gerudo.

It's the largest settlement in these parts.
It's got a lively market, and a canteen...
The town's active from morning to night!
But... Well, they have a rule that'll affect
you—guys aren't allowed in.
\""No voe may enter!\"" they say..."
16,Talk_103,"アナタその服
ゲルドの街で買ったんじゃないの？
市場 にぎわってたでしょ？
酒場には もう行った？
ゲルドの街はこの辺りでは一番大きな街で
昼でも夜でも賑やかなんだ
今は神獣が怖くって戻れないんだけど…

早く街に戻って
また酒場でのんびりしたいなぁ…","Didn't you buy that outfit at 
Gerudo Town?

It's the largest settlement in these parts.
It's got a lively market and a canteen...
The town's active at all hours!
But the Divine Beast has been stomping
around and is generally being dangerous,
so I can't go back right now..."
17,Talk_105,"はぁ…黒焦げも嫌だし…
ここにずっといるのも嫌だし…
誰でもいいから早くあの神獣を
どうにかしてくれないかしら…","I don't want to be stuck here, but I don't
want to be zapped by an angry
creature's lightning, either...
If only someone, perhaps a hero just
passing through town, could take care of
the Divine Beast..."
