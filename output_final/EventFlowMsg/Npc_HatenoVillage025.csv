何をしている？何を企んでる？
","Isn't that old Purah's blue flame?
What are you up to with it?"
13,talk05,"プルア婆ちゃんの炎…
なぜ おまえが運んでいる…","Hey! That's Purah's flame! How come
you're messing with it?"
14,talk06,おい…,"Hey, you."

16,talk08,待て！,"Cut it out, creep!"
17,talk09,"…何だ そのキョトンとした顔は！

……

どうやら おまえ…
敵意は なさそうだ
ハテノビーチに棲みついた魔物に
ヒツジたちを奪われて気が立っていた… 
このままじゃ他のヒツジたちも…","Oh, don't act so clueless.Although... Fine.You seem harmless enough. Forgive me,
I've just been on edge with all these
monsters running around.
They come up from Hateno Beach to
steal my sheep. If someone doesn't do
something soon, I won't have any left!"
18,talk10,ハテノビーチの魔物…,"I hate that gang of monsters on 
Hateno Beach..."
19,talk11,"目が合うと武器で殴りかかってくる
忌まわしいヤツら…
つい最近 ここで鉢合せしたとき
畑のフォーク振り回して なんとか撃退した
だけど ヤツらが巣食うハテノビーチまで
深追いできなかった… 
道中にも魔物は潜んでいそうだし
向こうは全部で7匹もいたし…","The stupid ones who attack anything
that moves. Last time they showed up,
I gave them a taste of my pitchfork.
But I had second thoughts about
following them back to their camp
on Hateno Beach.
I was mad enough to spit but maybe
not mad enough to take on seven
monsters at once."
20,talk12,"このハテノ村から南東に向かって
くねくね延びる道を歩いて行くと…
やがて眼下に広がるのが ハテノビーチ…

地図にも記されている美しい砂浜だ","It's southeast of the village. Follow the
winding road, and you'll be there before
you know it.
It's well-known enough that you can
probably find it on a map, come to that."
21,talk13,"さ…さよなら…

……

最初に おまえを敵視したこと…
悪かった…","Good... *sigh* Good-bye.I'm sorry if we got off on the wrong foot.
Uh...that's all..."
22,talk14,"ヒツジたちが落ち着きを取り戻した
危険が去ったことを感じ取ったらしい
私のカン違いだったら謝るが…

もしかして おまえが
魔物を退治してくれたのか？","The sheep have calmed down. I think
they get that they're not about to be
snatched at any moment.
Hey... Sorry if I'm off the mark in asking
this, but are you the one who took care
of those monsters?"
23,talk15,"やはり…

ヒツジ達が落ち着きを取り戻したので
もしかしたら…と思ったのだ
なんていうかその…ありがとうだ","I had a feeling.When the sheep all calmed down,
I thought, \""Maybe he did it...\""So it seems I owe you some thanks."
24,talk16,おい！はぐらかすな！,"Oh, no you don't!"
25,talk17,"いくら隠しても わかる…
ヒツジほどじゃないが私も感じ取った
なんていうかその…

ありがとうだ","You can't hide the truth from me.
I might not feel it in my bones like the
sheep do, but I'm no fool, either.
Which is to say...um... Thanks."
26,talk18,"これからは夜はぐっすり眠れる

それで… もしも嫌じゃなかったら
これからも気軽に話しかけ…
い…いや何でもない","It'll be nice to have a night's sleep
without worrying about my flock.

And, er... If you want...you can talk
to me anytime. O-or not!"
27,talk19,"お礼…こんなものしかないが…
たいした荷物には ならないはず","This isn't much of a reward, but hey,
it's light. That counts for something."
28,talk20,"…フレッシュミルクを やろうと思ったが
おまえ…ポーチが一杯だな
フレッシュミルクを いくつか
売るか使うかしたら また声をかけてくれ","I wanted to give you some fresh milk,
but you don't have room for any.Go drink some fresh milk—or sell it,
that works too—and come back."
29,talk22,"太陽の匂いは幸せの匂い…
そう思わないか？","Though, it could certainly be worse..."
30,talk23,"土の匂いは命の匂い…
そう思うんだ…","The scent of the soil is the smell of life
itself. If you ask me, anyway."
31,talk25,"あれから ヒツジたちは
よく食べ よく寝て よく乳を出すようになった
おまえのおかげだありがとう…","The sheep have been eating and sleeping
better. They're yielding more milk too.
You've single-handedly saved my flock!"
32,talk26,"それは…""ハテノ古代研究所の青い炎…

何をしてる？何かの儀式か？","Say...is that the blue flame from the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab?What are you doing with it? Some kind
of scientific ritual?"
33,talk27,"ハテノ古代研究所の炎…
どこへ運んでる？なぜ運んでいる？","That's the flame they use up at the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab! Where are
you taking it?"
34,talk28,他に聞きたい事は あるか？,Anything else you wanna know?
