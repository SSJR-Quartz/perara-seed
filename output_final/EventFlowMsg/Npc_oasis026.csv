7,Talk_20,"今日はハイリア人が良く来る日だな

ここはゲルド族の族長様が
いらっしゃる場所だ
我々は不審者が入らないよう警備中だ
あまり話しかけるんじゃない！","There sure are a lot of Hylians coming by
today.

This is the home of the chief of the
Gerudo. It is my duty to make sure that
no one suspicious enters.
Do not distract me from my job!"
8,Talk_21,"背が低い！！

髪が黄色い！！

腹筋が足りない！！！

それでゲルド族を名乗ろうなどと
片腹痛いわ！","You're short!


Your hair is the wrong color!!


And I can't even see your abs!!!


It is absolutely ridiculous for you to claim
that you're Gerudo. All evidence says
otherwise."
9,Talk_22,"忙しい！

緊急事態！！

関係者以外立ち入り禁止！！！

と言いたいところだが
我らの族長様は優しいお方でな
訪ねくる者は阻むなと言われている
入りたいなら好きにするんだな
しかし もし族長様に失礼があった時は…","We're busy!


It's an emergency!!


Authorized personnel only!!!


...That's what I would say if I had my
way, but the chief is a kind person.
She's told me to allow visitors.
If you want to go inside, be my guest.
But if you say even one rude thing to
the chief..."
10,Talk_23,"中に入るのは自由だが
族長様に失礼があったら…","You are free to go inside, but if you are
rude to the chief..."
11,Talk_25,この槍が黙ってないからな！,"You and my spear will have a very
personal conversation!"
12,Talk_26,"雷鳴の兜が盗まれてしまったのは
我ら警備兵の失態
本音を言うと今はゲルド族以外
誰も宮殿には入れたくないのだがな…","Allowing the Thunder Helm to be stolen
was a failure shared by everyone tasked
with guarding this town.
If I'm being honest, I'd prefer to ban all
but Gerudo from the palace for the
moment..."
13,Talk_27,"今は厳戒態勢中だ！

本音を言うと今はゲルド族以外
誰も宮殿には入れたくないのだがな…","Security is really tight lately!
I'd rather there only be Gerudo in the
palace right now, if I could make it so..."
14,Talk_28,"ナボリスが鎮まり 
ここからの景観もすっかり変わってしまった
変わったというより
元に戻っただけなんだがな
ハイリア人は小さく力もないと思っていたが
なかなかやるじゃないか…","Now that Naboris has calmed, it seems
like the desert is different... I suppose it
is, actually. It's back to normal now.
I thought that Hylians were a small, weak
little people, but you're not so bad..."
15,Talk_29,"背が低い！！

髪が黄色い！！

腹筋が足りない！！！

……しかし

…世のヴォーイは ギャップに弱いと聞く
その華奢なボディに秘められた力…
お前…モテヴァーイというやつだな！","You're short!


You're blond!!


And I can't even see your abs!!!


Though... I can imagine that those traits
might be considered appealing in the
outside world...
In some eyes, you'd be considered an
attractive vai, then."
16,Talk_30,"もちろん！

いつでも！！

ウエルカム！！！

だ！

お前はもう我らの仲間も同然
我々は お前をいつでも歓迎するぞ！","Of course!


Anytime!!


You're welcome!!!


Naturally, you are already one of us! You
are welcome here anytime!"
17,Talk_32,"さよならではない！

お前はもう我らの仲間同然
仲間なら「サヴォーク」だ！","Not \""good-bye\""!


You're among friends here. It's
sav'orq!"
18,Talk_33,サヴァーク,Sav'aaq.
19,Talk_34,サヴォッタ,Sav'otta.
20,Talk_35,サヴァサーバ,Sav'saaba.
21,Talk_36,"このミツバというヴァーイと言い…
お前と言い…
今日は ハイリア人が良く来る日だな…","First that vai, Traysi, and now you...
There sure are a lot of Hylians coming
around today."
22,Talk_37,"監視所ならこの街の南東門から
行くといいだろう
詳しいことは そこの兵士に聞くがいい","It's best to head to the lookout post
through the southeastern gate.

Ask the guard there for directions."
23,Talk_38,"族長様だったら
監視所にお出かけになられた
雷鳴の兜が我らの手に戻り まずは一安心だが

まだまだ気は抜けぬ
ゲルド族の誇りにかけ
もう二度とこのような失態がないようにせねば！","The chief has left for the lookout post.


We can breathe a little easier now that
we have the Thunder Helm back, but we
can't let our guard down again.
For the good of Gerudo pride, we must
make sure that such an embarrassment
never, ever happens again!"
24,Talk_39,"族長様お一人で監視所に向かわれたようだが
大丈夫だろうか…
まぁ族長様に手出ししようとする
不届き者がいようものなら","The chief left on her own, but I wonder
if she'll be all right.

If I meet anyone flouting the rule of law..."
25,Talk_40,このツィーザの槍のサビにするだけだがな,"They'll have a sudden meeting with the
sharp end of my spear."
26,Talk_41,"それにしても…
人は見かけによらないものだな","I suppose you could say...
It would be a mistake to judge people
on appearances alone."
27,Talk_42,"「サボーク」ではない！

「サヴォーク！」だ！
お前はもう我らの仲間同然なのだ
「ヴォ」の発音ぐらい しっかりせんか！","It's not \""sav'ork\""!


You're a friend to the Gerudo now, and
it's \""sav'orq\"" among friends!

You just need to work on your
pronunciation a little bit!"
28,Talk_43,"ナボリスが鎮まり 
ここからの景観もすっかり変わってしまった
変わったというより
元に戻っただけなんだがな
ハイリア人は小さく力もないと思っていたが
なかなかやるじゃないか…","Now that Naboris has been appeased,
the desert seems different... I suppose
it is, actually. It's back to normal now.
I thought that Hylians were a small, weak
little people, but you're not so bad..."
29,Talk_44,"それにしても…
人は見かけによらないものだな","I suppose you could say...
It would be a mistake to judge people
on appearances alone."
30,Talk_45,"族長様は お前に任せたと言っていたが
監視所から お戻りになられてからずっと
ため息ばかりついておられる

お前の事がよほど心配だったらしいな

さっ早く中へ

お前の元気な姿を見れば
族長様も安心されることだろう","The chief said she'd leave everything to
you, but ever since she returned, I could
tell something was wrong.
She was clearly worried about you.
You should hurry to her at once.
I'm sure she'll be relieved to see you."
31,Talk_46,待ちわびていたぞ！,We've been waiting for you!
