17,talk01,"旅の途中かな？
トンプー亭には もう泊まった？",Ever stayed at the Ton Pu Inn?
18,talk02,まあ どっちでもいいんだけど…,"Makes no difference to me, but..."
19,talk03,宿を利用しないってことは まさか…,"If you're not staying there, then..."
20,talk04,"このハテノ村に住み着いちゃおうなんて
思ってないよな？","I'm supposed to check out everyone who
comes into town."
21,talk05,だよな,Thought so.
22,talk06,"この村は平和だけど
外は まだまだ物騒らしいな
だからこそ こうして俺が
ツキミさんに言い寄る ヨソ者…
じゃなくて…""村の平和を乱すヨソ者が
入ってこないように警備してるってわけよ","I know things have been peaceful 
recently, but the outside world is
still pretty dangerous, yeah?
So I gotta check and make sure if any
beauties—er, I mean—suspicious
folks have come around here."
23,talk07,"それはちょっと受け入れがたいな
なぜなら恋のライバルが増え…
いや なんでもない なんでもない…","YOUR job is weird.


...Whatever it is you do."
24,talk08,あんたの事でも あるんだけどな…,*sigh*

この村には美人が多いと思わねえか？
トンプー亭のツキミさんも そうだけど

プルア婆さんも若い頃は
カワイイ感じだったと思うなぁ","This is totally unrelated, but this village
has its share of beauties, huh?
Like Prima at the Ton Pu Inn.
I bet that Purah was a looker when she
was young too, y'know?"
28,talk14,あんたは…,"Checkin' everyone out today, too. The
checkin' just never stops..."
29,talk15,恋の炎は雨でも消せぬ～ときたもんだ…,"Night or day, don't matter. Gotta check

34,talk20,"カワイコちゃんチェック…
じゃなくて観光客チェックしてるよ
まツキミさんに敵うカワイコちゃんは
居ねーけどな
そう言えば…なんか 100年前に居た
ハイラル城の姫様も相当可愛かったらしいけど
きっと ツキミさんみたいに
清楚な感じだったんだろうなー
妄想が止まらないぜ…","Just checking out the beauties—
er, I mean tourists—er, I mean—
suspicious folk! That's what I'm doing!
Well...if we're gonna talk about beauties,
though, no one can hold a candle to
Prima, y'know?
They say the princess of Hyrule Castle
who lived 100 years ago was super
pretty, too.
Maybe she coulda given Prima a run for
her beauty, but that's the level we're
talkin' about here."
35,talk21,"あれ？お前知らないのか？

姫様ってのは大厄災に飲み込まれた
って言う ハイラル城の姫様よ
それを機に天変地異が治まったって話だぜ

おかげで今の平和があるんだろうし
その姫様には感謝しねーとな","Really?! Are you serious?


The princess of Hyrule Castle who got
swallowed up by the Great Calamity!

That's the only reason we got peace here
now. We really owe that princess."
36,talk22,"大厄災ってのは 100年前に起きた
天変地異の事よ
伝説化しちゃってて ある人は蛇って言ったり
別の人は黒い霧って言ったりしてな
俺も見た訳じゃねーから よく分かんないけど
お年寄りなら その辺詳しいんじゃねーかな？","The Great Calamity was that awful thing
from 100 years ago! You been asleep
inside a cave or somethin'?!
Some people will say it was some kind
of serpent. Others say it was like some
kind of black fog or something.
I didn't see it myself, so I don't really
know. But the old timers around here
might know more about it."
37,talk23,何か用？,What is it?
38,talk24,まだ何かあんの？,You need anything else?
39,talk25,"とより あんた…
ツキミさんとは もう会ったか？
まぁ会ったってかまわないが
年下のかわいい少年アピールは ほどほどにな","If you're lucky enough to stay at the
Ton Pu Inn, you'll see what I mean.
Say hullo to Prima for me if you do.
Not that she even knows who I am..."
40,talk26,「さん」を付けろよ 「さん」を！,"That's Ms. Prima to you! You ever been
to the inn here?"
41,talk28,"ああ… それにしても悩ましい…
わが愛しの人に何を贈るべきか…",This is tough... I have to give her SOMETHING...
42,talk29,"ところでさぁ…トンプー亭のツキミさんを
喜ばせるには何を贈ったらいいと思う？
俺がって事じゃないんだ
友達の友達に相談されて困っちゃってさぁ","What kind of gift do you think Prima at
the Ton Pu Inn would want? Just take
a guess.
It's not for me, you understand.
It's for...my buddy's friend."
43,talk30,"えっ？ツキミさんが欲しがってるものを？！
本人に聞いてきてくれたの？！
おっと…あまり興奮しすぎると
知りたがってるのが俺だってこと バレちゃうな…
と…友達の友達に教えてあげなきゃ！
ツキミさんの欲しがってるものって何だ？","What? Prima told you what she wants?!
Prima...never even talks to me...

*ahem* I mean, that's cool, that's cool...


SO THEN, WHAT IS IT?!"
44,talk31,"えっ ガンバリバッタ もう捕まえてきたの？
仕事できるな あんた！
俺なんか まだ一匹も捕まえてないのに…","You have some restless crickets
already?! Wow, that was fast!

I haven't even caught one yet..."
45,talk32,"ひぃ ふぅ みぃ…
","You really got them? I thought you
were just messing with me."
46,talk33,"…数えるまでもなく
10匹いないよね？
ツキミさん待ってるからさ
頼むよ もうひとガンバリ ふたガンバリ…","...Uh, I'm no counting scientist, but I
think that's less than 10.

C'mon, man! I got a date with Prima
riding on this! Help me out."
47,talk34,"おお！たしかに10匹！
じゃあ…俺が預からせてもらうよ","OK, so... Hrm...


Yup, that's 10. Thanks, I'll take 'em."
48,talk35,じゃこいつは お礼な,A little somethin' for your troubles...
49,talk36,"ガンバリバッタを？100匹？！

そうそう！そういう謎めいたところも
ツキミさんの魅力なんだよ！
…って友達の友達は言ってるらしいぞ

興奮しすぎた あぶねえあぶねえ

でもガンバリバッタを100匹集めるのは
愛しい人のためとはいえ キツそうだな
そうだ あんた手伝ってやれよ！
けっこう虫とか捕ってきたほうだろ？
そうだな…
とりあえず10匹集めてくれ
お礼は弾むからさ！
俺の友達の友達のために よろしく頼む！","Prima wants restless crickets? And 100
of them?! Hahaha! What a small world!

I love restless crickets! I'm a
connoisseur of them! 

I think that's what that word means...


But catching 100 of them is gonna be
tough. Think you could help me get
started on those?
How about you get me...10 of them? I'll
get you something nice for your trouble."
50,talk37,"よーし…
じゃあ後は俺が必死こいて集めるわ
愛しいツキミさんとのデートを夢見て…

このマンサク草原を駆けまわっちゃうぞ！

…あ今ので完全にバレたな","Right then! I'll go ahead and catch the
rest of 'em.

Then I'll take 'em to Prima and we'll have
that d-d-date...

Oh, no! My s-s-s-stutter..."
51,talk38,"だから恋の警備ってのはだな…

いや…恋は関係ない関係ない

この村の平和を乱す悪いやつが
入って来ないように見張ってんの！","There's weird, suspicious folks out there!
So I gotta check everyone out to make
sure no one dangerous gets through.
I'm volunteerin' my own time because
it's an important service for the village."
52,talk39,"それ プルア婆さんのだろ？
最近見ないけど お元気なのかな？","That's Purah's, right? I haven't seen her
in a while. Wonder how she's doing..."
53,talk40,"それ研究所の所長さんのだろ？
最近見ないけど お元気なのかな？","That's the lab director's, right? I wonder
how they're all doin' up there..."
54,talk41,"捕まえてきたガンバリバッタ…
見せてくれよ","Well, lemme see those restless crickets
you caught!"
55,talk42,だから「さん」を付けろって！,"I already told you, that's Ms. Prima!"
56,talk43,"ツキミさんはトンプー亭っていう
宿屋の受付の女性だよ","Prima works at the Ton Pu Inn. She's
the lady at the front desk."
57,talk44,"ツキミさんは そこの宿屋…
トンプー亭の受付の女性だよ",Prima is the clerk over at the Ton Pu Inn.
