Owwww..."
17,talk01,"旅の人には関係無い話だぜ…

チクショウ…あのバケモンめ…","No offense, but this is not your concern.


That cursed monster..."
18,talk02,"ああ… 

こんな事になるんだったら
族長の言う事を聞いとくべきだったぜ…","Not really...


If this is what we are up against, we
should have put more stock in the
elder's words."
19,talk03,"アンタ…
空のバケモンの事嗅ぎ回ってんだろ…？
だったら あの日の事を教えてやるよ","Hey, buddy... I'm guessing you caught
wind of that monster circling around
our village.
I suppose I should get you up to speed
on what went down."
20,talk04,"よし いいぜ…

この傷は今空を飛んでるバケモン…
神獣 ヴァ・メドーに撃たれて できたヤツさ
神獣 ヴァ・メドー…
かつては村の守り神だったらしいな
しかし アイツ…俺とテバが近付いた途端
いきなり撃ってきやがった
必死で応戦する中
俺は不覚にも ヤツの攻撃を喰らっちまった
墜落する俺を テバが拾ってくれたんだが
そうなりゃもう退散しかねぇ
テバが居なかったらと思うと…
今考えても ゾッとするぜ
…で そのテバを探すんだろ？
知ってる範囲で教えてやるよ","Here goes...


You see this wound here on my wing?
I got shot by that thing in the sky,
Divine Beast Vah Medoh.
Legend has it, that monster was once
the protector of this village.

But those days are long gone—as soon
as Teba and I approached the thing, it
just shot at us out of nowhere.
We tried to fight back, but I was too slow
and got hit.

Thankfully, Teba caught me while I was
falling from the sky. We had no choice
but to retreat.
When I think about what would have
happened had Teba not been there...
Still gives me the bumps.
So you planning to go find Teba?
I will tell you everything I know."
21,talk05,"アンタ…""聞いてるぜ
やったんだろ？ あの神獣 ヴァ・メドーを…
テバも戻って来た事だし
いいとこ全部 アンタに持っていかれたな
ま とりあえず礼を言わせてくれ
ありがとよ","Hey, bud! I heard the whole story.
That was you, yeah? You conquered
Divine Beast Vah Medoh?
And Teba is safe at home too? Looks like
you went and did everything while I was
out of the game.
I guess I owe you one.
Thanks, pal."
22,talk06,"アンタ…テバと会ったんだろ…？

何を言われたのかは知らんが
アイツは言い出したら引っ込まねぇ
ヤツを…テバを頼むぜ","Hey, bud. You meet with Teba?


I imagine he is planning something crazy.
I would ask you to talk him out of it, but
I know better than that."
23,talk07,"…テバの所に行くんだろ？
神獣 ヴァ・メドーの事…教えてやるよ","Are you going to see Teba? I will tell you
everything I know about
Divine Beast Vah Medoh."
24,talk08,…ありがとよ,...Thanks.
25,talk09,"…行くんだろ？""聞かなくていいのかよ","...Are you leaving? But I have more to
say!"
26,talk10,"テバ… アイツは昔っからのダチで
飛ぶ事に関しては右に出る者は居ねぇ
無鉄砲ですぐに頭に血が上るのが玉にキズだが
仲間想いの いいヤツだぜ
しかし アイツ…「メドーをぶっ潰す」っつって 
また行っちまったが1人とは無謀過ぎる…
奥さんも子供も居るってのに バカなヤツだぜ…","Teba. Him and I go way back.
As far as flying goes, he is undoubtedly
the best in the village. 
His only downside is that he's reckless...
and has a bit of a temper...and he can be
rude. But we look out for each other.
But the way he was talking...saying that
he was going to \""blow Medoh out of
the sky.\""
He wants to go back up there...alone.
Which is absolutely insane. What kind of
moron with a wife and a kid does that?"
27,talk11,"俺は弓職人のハーツ

俺も昔は戦士を目指してたんだが
家業を継ぐんで辞めちまった
娘のモモが
テバんとこのチューリと歳が近くてな
なので テバとは家族ぐるみの
付き合いをさせてもらっている
…ってか こんな話役に立つのか？","I am Harth. Bow craft is my trade. 


My boyhood dream was to be a warrior,
but I gave that up once it came time to
inherit the family business.
My daughter, Molli, is around the same
age as Teba's kid, Tulin, so our families
spend a lot of time together.
Hold on... Is any of this helpful at all?"
28,talk12,"神獣 ヴァ・メドー…

古い人の話じゃ
100年前に姿を消した村の守り神だけどな
そう思って テバと偵察に行ったら
ガンガン撃ってきやがって このザマよ
今度行くときゃ大量にバクダン矢持ってって
砲台全部ぶっ壊してやらぁ","Divine Beast Vah Medoh...


I don't believe it myself, but some say
it used to protect our village before 
disappearing 100 years ago.
Teba and I got to wondering about it,
and when we went to investigate, it just
opened fire on us...hence the injury.
But as soon as I recover, I plan to fly up
there with a whole mess of bomb arrows
and blow its cannons to bits!"
29,talk13,…テバを頼んだぜ,...Help Teba for me.
30,talk14,…痛てて,Owww...
31,talk15,…俺？,...Me?
32,talk16,…で他に聞きたい事は？,Anything else you wanted to ask about?
33,talk17,"…テバから聞いてるぜ

神獣 ヴァ・メドーを仕留めたハイリア人って
アンタの事だろ？","I heard about it from Teba.


So you are the Hylian who conquered
Divine Beast Vah Medoh?"
34,talk18,"テバが村に戻ってきた事
そしてメドーを鎮め この村を救ってくれた事
俺からも まとめて礼を言わせてくれ
ありがとよ","You brought Teba back safely, and you
saved the village by dealing with
Medoh.
I wanted you to hear it from me too:
thanks, pal. We are in your debt."
35,talk20,いらっしゃい…っつつ…,"Ugh... 
Welcome...
Oww..."
36,talk21,いらっしゃい…何の用だい？,"Welcome...
What do you want?"
37,talk22,"俺は弓職人のハーツ…

だがよ…今は片腕が上がんねぇから
開店休業よ","I am Harth, the bow craftsman.


But... I cannot raise my arm right now, so
business is not exactly booming."
38,talk23,おい…,Hey...
39,talk24,"フン…持ってけよ…
どうせ今の俺には使えねぇからな","Heh... Take it.
Not like I can use it in my condition."
40,talk25,"いいぜ持ってけよ
メドーを鎮めてくれた礼だ","Sure, go ahead and take it.
Consider it thanks for conquering
Medoh."
41,talk26,"さて今の俺にできるのは
おしゃべりくらいだが…","I have nothing but time, so ask away."
42,talk51,"もしオオワシの弓を壊したり無くしたりしたら 
俺が作り直してやっから
ツバメの弓と薪の束が5つ
それとダイヤモンドを俺ンとこに持って来な","If you break or lose the Great Eagle Bow,
I can make a new one for you.

But you will need to bring me a
swallow bow, five bundles of wood,
and a diamond."
43,talk52,"で そのオオワシの弓
持ってねぇようだけど…無くしたのか？
作り直すンならツバメの弓とダイヤモンド
それと薪の束が5つ必要なんだが…","I cannot help but notice that your
Great Eagle Bow is missing.

If you want me to make another one,
I will need a swallow bow, a diamond,
and five bundles of wood."
44,talk53,"ダイヤモンドは なかなか手に入らねぇブツだが
本当にいいんだな？","Diamonds are pretty tough to come by.
Are you sure?"
45,talk54,"よし… それじゃ早速作業に取り掛かる
ちぃとそこで待っててくれや",All right... Just wait over there for a bit.
46,talk55,"そうか…
作り直したくなったら また来いよな","Got it...
Stop by whenever you want me to make
you another one."
47,talk56,"よし…""最高のが出来たぜ
大切に使ってくれ","Here ya go... I made a beauty for you.
Take good care of it."
48,talk57,"オオワシの弓を持ってねぇようだけど
…落としたのか？
作り直してやってもいいが
まずは近くに無ぇか よく探してみな","Where is your Great Eagle Bow? Did you
drop it somewhere?

I can make you another one, but they are
expensive to make. Maybe you should try
to find your old one first."
49,talk58,"アンタ全部持っているようだな
なんだったら作り直してやろうか？","Looks like you got everything ready.
Should I make you a new one?"
50,talk59,"作り直すなら素材を揃えて
俺ンとこまで持って来いよ","If you want me to make one, get the
materials together and come back."
51,talk60,アンタ全く何も持ってねぇな…,"Ah... You did not bring me anything I
need to make it."
52,talk61,アンタツバメの弓を持ってねぇぜ,You did not bring a swallow bow.
53,talk62,アンタダイヤモンドを持ってねぇぜ,You do not have a diamond.
54,talk63,薪の束が足りてねぇぜ,I am going to need more wood than that.
55,talk64,"アンタ… まずツバメの弓を持ってねぇし
薪の束も足りてねぇ","Listen, bud... You did not bring me a 
swallow bow, and you do not have
enough wood."
56,talk65,"アンタ…""ツバメの弓とダイヤモンドを
持ってねぇよな","Hey, bud... You did not bring me a
swallow bow or a diamond."
57,talk66,"アンタ…""ダイヤモンドを持ってねぇ

I need more wood than that."

elder, right?"
