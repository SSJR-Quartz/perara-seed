6,Talk_000,"ここはカラカラバザールだ
ゲルドの街までの休息地のようなもんだ
旅人ならここで ゆっくりしていくがいい

といっても お前はヴォーイなので
ゲルドの街には入れんがな
まぁ どちらにしても今は神獣が暴れてる
街の方へ行くのは やめておくんだな","This is Kara Kara Bazaar.


Gerudo Town is still a fair distance
southwest of here. If you're headed
there, you should consider resting a bit.
Though, you ARE a voe... Even if you
make it to town, you won't be able to
get in...
All the same, the Divine Beast is kicking
up a storm right now, so I don't
recommend going to Gerudo Town."
7,Talk_001,"神獣 ヴァ・ナボリスのことを知らんのか？

かつては ゲルド族の守り神として
祀られたこともあったと聞くが
しばらく前から急に現れ暴れだしてな…

どうにかしようにも神獣は砂嵐と雷に
守られていて手が付けられんのだ
しかし いつゲルドの街やここに
近づくかわからんのでな
私はこうやって
ずっと見張っているんだ","You don't know about Divine Beast Vah
Naboris?

Supposedly, it is the guardian deity for
the Gerudo people, but it suddenly
started acting up a while back.
There's nothing we can do to stop it,
either... It's protected by a fierce
sandstorm and intense lightning.
Though it hasn't yet, it could easily head
toward Gerudo Town or this oasis. I do
my best to keep an eye on it from here."
8,Talk_002,"ゲルド人と話したいなら
ゲルド語を少し覚えておくと いいだろう
さよならは「サヴォーク」だ！","If you want to speak with the Gerudo,
you should learn some of our language.
For example, \""sav'orq\"" is \""good-bye\""!"
9,Talk_003,"まぁ ここまで神獣は来ないだろうが…
念のため警備しとかんとな
お前もゲルドの街に行くなら気を付けんと
せっかくの衣装が ボロボロになりかねんぞ","Well, the Divine Beast probably won't
head in this direction... But we should
be on alert, just in case.
If you're going to Gerudo Town, you
should definitely be careful... The harsh
desert could tear up your nice outfit."
10,Talk_004,"神獣が大人しくなったとはいえ
砂漠は魔物も多く危険な場所だ
引き続き警備は続けんとな","And while the Divine Beast has settled
down, the desert is still full of monsters.
You should stay on your guard."
11,Talk_005,"ここはカラカラバザール
ゲルドの街までの休息地のようなもんだ
まぁ神獣も暴れているし今は街へ行くより
ここで ゆっくりするといいだろう","This is Kara Kara Bazaar.


Gerudo Town is still a fair distance
from here. If you're headed there, you
should consider resting a bit.
Although... The Divine Beast is kicking
up a storm right now, so it would be very
dangerous to head that way."
12,Talk_006,"砂漠の夜は冷えるぞ

カラカラバザールの中は大丈夫だが
外に行くときは体を冷やさんようにな","Did you know that desert nights get
incredibly cold?

You'll be fine as long as you're in
Kara Kara Bazaar, but it can get really
chilly the farther away you wander."
13,Talk_007,"太陽がでてきたな…

太陽がある時間は砂漠は灼熱となる
身体を冷やすことを忘れんようにな","The sun is really starting to beat down
on us now...

The desert is incredibly hot so long as
the sun is blazing down on it. Be sure to
keep yourself cool as you travel."
14,Talk_008,"ゲルドの街は ここから南西の方角にある
この辺りで一番大きな街だ！
交易の場としても有名で
不夜城としても名高い活気あふれる街だ
しかし ゲルド族の掟により
ヴォーイ… つまり男は中に入れないのだ","Gerudo Town is to the southwest. It's the
biggest town in the area!

It's famous for trade and also for staying
active and vibrant all night long.

However, there is a law forbidding
voe—males—from entering the city."
15,Talk_009,"ほぅ…

ゲルドの民族衣装を着た
ハイリア人を見たのは これで二人目だが…
もう一人のヴァーイの方が
体つきもたくましく我らに近い印象だったな
いや… もちろんお前も似合っているぞ

ゲルド族の衣装が ハイリア人に
そんなに人気だとは知らなかったな","Well, well...


You're the second Hylian I've seen
wearing Gerudo-style clothing.

The other one looked much more Gerudo
though, if I'm being honest. Not that it
doesn't look good on you, too.
I didn't realize that Gerudo clothing
was so popular among Hylians..."
16,Talk_011,"神獣が大人しくなったとはいえ
砂漠は危険だからな まだまだ気は抜けん！
しかし…

そろそろ交代の者が来てもいいと思うんだが…

早く帰って酒場で一杯
やりたいよ…","Even though the Divine Beast has settled
down, the desert is still full of monsters.
We can't afford to be complacent!
I think it's just about time for someone to
come relieve me...

I really want to get back in time to grab a drink and
relax at the canteen..."

21,Talk_016,"その服 よく似合ってるな

神獣が大人しくなったとはいえ
砂漠は魔物も多く危険な場所だ
まだ警備は続けないといけないが…

仕事が終わったら
私も一張羅に着替えて出かけるとしようかな","Those clothes look good on you.


And while the Divine Beast has settled
down, the desert is still full of monsters.

This is my job after all.

You know, the desert is hot during the
day and cold at night. It'll take the
energy out of you in no time.

ここにはゲルドの街と交易を望む

そういえば さっき宿屋に入る
ハイリアヴァーイの商人を見かけたよ
ゲルドの民族衣装を着ていたから
なんだか目についてな
きっと神獣が怖くて街にいけないんだろう…
可哀想に…","Oh, yes. And many, many more than just
one, to be sure.

That's because all the voe merchants are
gathered here, hoping to get access to
Gerudo Town.
They refuse to give up, even though voe
are strictly forbidden from entering
the town.
Although... Now that you mention it, one
merchant in particular did stand out
to me.
I saw a Hylian vai merchant at the inn
before. She was wearing traditional
Gerudo clothes, which caught my eye.
She's probably still around town;
that Divine Beast is scaring a lot of
people out of traveling."
