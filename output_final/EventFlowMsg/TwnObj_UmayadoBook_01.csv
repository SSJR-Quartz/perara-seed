みんな毎日ウワサしてる？
今回の気になるウワサはコレ！

『退魔の剣』

この剣を手にできる者は
勇者の血を受け継ぐ者だけ…
なーんて ウワサがあるこの剣

名もなき深い森の中に
隠されとるっちゅう話やで～
気にはなるけど うちのオトンもオカンも
どうみても勇者の血統って感じちゃうし
ウチにはあんまり関係なさそうやな…
ミツバおススメ度 ★☆☆☆☆","Greetings from Traysi—your source for
the best gossip and news!

Have you been hearing any good stories
on your travels? I've got a great one for
you today!
The Sword that Seals the
Darkness

The only one who can wield this sword
carries the blood of the hero in their
veins.
That's what they say about this special
blade! Rumor has it the blade has been
hidden away in a forest somewhere...
I have to admit that this rumor really has
me interested, but sometimes you have
to face reality.
My reality is... There isn't any hero in my
bloodline, so this sword would just be a
big paperweight to me...
Traysi's Recommendation: ★☆☆☆☆"
