16,talk06,"だから噂の伝説の剣をゲットすれば
活路が見えんじゃねーか？ってな","That's why I thought, if I can get that

どうやら こっち側ではないみてぇなんだよな

ひょっとしたら反対側の森の馬宿の方か…","That's right!


I finally figured out that it's near
Death Mountain. However...it doesn't
seem to be in this direction.
Maybe it's on the opposite side,
closer to the Woodland Stable..."

ちょっと行き詰まっちまってな
ま今使ってる剣が ナマクラなだけだけどよ","I was really into sword fighting,

29,talk20,"伝説の剣は森の奥深くに眠ってると聞くが
その森に入って出て来たヤツは居ねぇんだぜ？","I hear the legendary sword is hidden
deep in a forest. But no one has ever
returned from that forest..."
