3,talk00,"はぁ… はぁ…
ボブル先輩の訓練はキツイけど…
賊に入られたのは私達の責任…
私達が弱音を吐くわけにはいかん…","*pant pant*
Babi's training is really tough, but...

It's our fault the thieves were successful.
We have no room to complain."
4,talk01,"お前のお陰で兜も戻ってきたからな
私達もやっと休憩だよ…
といっても…槍の手入れが終わったら
また特訓なんだと…
はぁ… ほんと先輩元気だよな…","Thanks to you bringing back the chief's
heirloom, we can finally take a break...

In theory, anyway. More likely, once we
finish repairing our spears, we'll have to
get started on more special training.
*sigh* Babi's always got more special training..."
5,talk02,"それにしても兜が戻ってきたってのに
先輩頑張りすぎだよ…
ああはなりたくないわ～","Babi is working way too hard, even
though the chief's heirloom is back!

I hope I never become as intense
as her..."
6,talk03,"お前のお陰で兜も戻ってきたからな
私達もやっと休憩だ…
向こうのチームは またバレッタがいないとか
騒いでいるようだけどな…
あの子は いつも1人で行動して
トラブルに巻き込まれるんだよな…","Thanks to your bringing back the chief's
heirloom, we can finally take a break.

The team over there is in a tizzy, though,
because Barta disappeared again.

That kid is always going off by herself
and getting wrapped up in trouble..."
7,talk04,"ほんとバレッタと
同じチームじゃなくてよかったよ…
ボブル先輩だけで手いっぱいだからな…","I'm seriously glad that I'm not on the
same team as Barta.

I already have my hands full with Babi..."
8,talk05,"兜を奪還したハイリア人というのは
お前のようだな…
賊どもに私の槍さばきを
見せられなかったのが残念だが
いつかお前とは
手合わせ願いたいものだな","From what I hear, you're the Hylian that
recovered the helm for the chief.

It's a shame I didn't get to show those
thieves what I can do with my spear,
though.
Anyway, maybe someday you and I can
get a little sparring in? We might both
learn something..."
9,talk06,"兜を奪還した ハイリア人というのは
お前のようだな…
賊だけでなく神獣まで
大人しくさせてしまうほどの腕前…
いつかお前とは
手合わせ願いたいものだ","From what I hear, you're the Hylian that
recovered the helm for the chief.

Not only did you take care of the thieves,
but you also had the skill to calm the
Divine Beast...
Anyway, maybe someday you and I can
get a little sparring in? I might really
learn something..."
