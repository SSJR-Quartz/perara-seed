7,LookPicture,"ええ？！これが骨の馬？
スタルホース…こんな化け物なん？
うわぁ～夢に出てきそうやわぁ～
めっちゃ怖い…けど この絵 すごいなぁ！","Wha—? This is the bony horse?
That Stalhorse... It's a monster!

The sight of this is going to haunt my
dreams for weeks... But the picture is
still amazing!"
8,Talk_000,"骨の馬なんて ホンマにおるんやろうか…自分の目で見んと信じられへんけど
寒いとこは苦手なんよなぁ…","I wonder if bone horses are a real
thing... I'd have to see it to believe it,
but I really don't like cold places, so..."
9,Talk_000_slp,"骨の馬""見つけるのに頭使たから眠いんや…
情報屋イチヨウちゃんは閉店や…","I'm so tired... I've been thinking about
bone horses all day.

I've got the info, but I'm all done for
today, I think..."
10,Talk_001,"ハイラルで一番ええ情報持っとる
イチヨウさんとは ウチのことや
ああ アンタ… リンクくんいうんやろ？","If you're seeking the best information in
Hyrule, I, Juannelle, know everything

まあええわ そんだけウチの情報が
欲しいってことなんやろ？","I hope you realize how rude it is to wake
me up when I'm trying to sleep...

I'll forgive you, though. You clearly are
desperate for the kind of info only
I can provide!"
18,Talk_300,"で何の情報聞きたいん？真っ暗い遺跡の情報と
ヘブラ山脈の最果ての情報あるけど？","Soooo, what do you wanna know?


I have info on the pitch-black ruins
and on what's at the far edge of the
Hebra Mountains."
19,Talk_301,"その遺跡は光がまったく入らん…
昼間でも自分の手が見えへんくらいなんやって
えらい不思議な力が関係しとるって
カンジやろ？
そんな遺跡の中に何があるんか…
見つけたら名前売れると思うんやけどね～
場所？ウォルナー山を越えて
オルディン山脈を目指して行くとあるらしいで","Light is unable to enter these ruins for
some reason. It's said that you can't see
an inch ahead, even during the day!
There must be some mysterious power
behind this phenomenon, don't
you think?
I can only wonder at what's hiding within
those ruins... But finding whatever it is
would certainly make you famous!
Where is it? It should be past
Mount Drena if you're heading toward
the Eldin Mountains."
20,Talk_310,"ヘブラ山脈でも一番すみっこ""北西の最果てまで
行くんや！って言う冒険家がおってな…
で山脈の一番北側まで行って そこから
ひたすら西に歩いたらしいんやけど…
結局途中で崖と吹き上げる風に阻まれて
最果てまでは進めんかったんやて
そんで「最果てには何があるん？」って
聞いたら…
「それが知りとうて行ってみたんや！」やて…

何があるかも知らんのに ようそんな
寒そうな場所に行こうとしたもんやで…","There was an adventurer who pledged
to journey to the northwesternmost
part of Hyrule...
To the very edge of the 
Hebra Mountains.

This adventurer went north of the
mountain range as far as possible and
then west...
However, steep cliffs and raging winds
stood in the way. The adventurer was
forced to turn back.
Upon returning, I posed a question to
the adventurer. I said, \""Why go so
far out there?\""
\""Because I wanted to know what was
there!\"" was the adventurer's reply.

I must admit, I don't think that'd be
enough for me. I can't believe someone
would want to go into the cold unknown."
21,Talk_320,ほなね,See ya.
