1,"""0000""",自信しかない,Pretty confident.
2,0000_00,"はたして その自信は本物か？
若さ故の過信ほど怖いものは無いからな
どうだ？
ここでひとつ腕試しをしていかぬか？","Yeah? You got the skills to back that
confidence up?Nothing's more dangerous than a man
who thinks he can handle the worst, only
to fall apart when the time comes.
What do you think? Are you confident
enough to prove you got the right stuff?"
3,0000_01,"青年よ
鍛錬をしに来たのか？",Young man...are you looking to drill?
4,"""0001""",あまり自信はない,"Uh, not too confident."
5,0001_00,"ふむ… それは実に心許ない
この先の魔物どもは手強いからな
提案だが…
ここで鍛錬をしていかぬか？","Hm... I don't like the sound of that.
The monsters out this way are strong
critters.
You're sure you don't want to drill with
me some?"
6,"""0002""",急いでいるので…,I'm in a hurry...
7,0002_00,"これは失敬""呼びとめてすまなかったな
汝の未来に幸有らんことを…","My apologies, then. I didn't mean to
speak out of turn. Happy trails and
straight shooting, young man."
8,"""0003""",しようかな,"Sure, I'm game."
9,"""0004""",腕試し？,Prove it how?
10,"""0005""",キョーミ無いね,I've nothing to prove.
11,"""0006""",鍛錬？,How do you mean?
12,"""0007""",知りたい,I do.
13,"""0008""",もう一度説明を…,Go over it again.
14,"""0009""",いいよ,Sure.
15,"""0010""",やだ,Nothing doing.
16,"""0011""",登録を済ませてくる,I'll register this one.
17,"""0012""",所有馬を連れてくる,I'll call my own horse.
18,"""0013""",競技をやめたい,I want to quit.
19,"""0014""",なんでもない,It's nothing.
20,"""0015""",それでもやめる,"Yeah, I quit anyway."
21,"""0016""",やっぱり続ける,"Fine, I'll keep going."
22,"""0017""",なくて大丈夫,Not really.
23,"""0018""",必要です,That would be nice.
24,"""0019""",買う,I'll buy.
25,"""0020""",売る,I'll sell.
26,"""0021""",いらない,"I'm fine, thanks."
27,Accompany_00,"そうか
愛馬との鍛錬が一番だと私も思うぞ","I'd agree that training with your trusty
horse is a smart move anytime."
28,Accompany_01,"その道に沿って進むと馬宿があったはずだ
そこから愛馬を連れてくると いいだろう","Head down that path there, and you
ought to come across a stable. Fetch
your steed from them if you got one."
29,Accompany_02,"連れて来たら
馬上より""改めて私に話しかけてくれ","Get a horse, mount up, then come talk
to me while you're riding high in the
saddle."
30,AskAgain,どうだ？ もう一度鍛錬していくか？,Well? You want to drill some more?
31,AskAgain_00,"また20ルピーを頂戴することになるが…
それでもいいな？","The price hasn't gone down any—
20 rupees, same as ever. That fine
with you?"
32,AskAgain_01,"そうか また顔を見せてくれ
雨の日も風の日も ここで汝を待つとしよう","Don't be a stranger, young man.
I'll be waiting here for you, come wind
or storm."
33,Explanation_00,"汝はヤブサメというものを御存知か？
遥か東方の異国の競技なのだが…
疾走する馬上より弓を番え的を射抜くという
なんとも流麗な競技なのだ
これより先馬上での戦いも多くなる故
この競技が力量を計る良い手立てかと思ってな","Ever heard of horseback archery? They
invented it way out east somewhere.It takes a lot of coordination to shoot
targets with a bow and arrow from the
back of a galloping horse.
I expect you'll run into mounted
varmints now and again, so this'll be a
good way to get some practice in."
34,Explanation_01,"そうだな…""20個以上の的を壊したら
私の持つ馬装備を譲ろうではないか","Tell you what... You break more than 20
targets, and I'll hand over my horse gear."
35,Explanation_02,"そうだな…""23個以上の的を壊したら
私の持つ馬装備を譲ろうではないか","Tell you what... You break more than 23
targets, and I'll hand over my horse gear."
36,GameEnd,"そこまで！
一度戻ってきてくれるか",Hold it! Head on back here.
37,GameInit_00,"流石に若いだけあって決断が速いな
その決断力が いつか汝を救うだろう","They say youth breeds impulsiveness,
but it's that kind of quick certainty that'll
save your hide. Maybe someday soon."
38,GameInit_01,"さて…""心苦しい話だが費用の一部として
20ルピーを頂戴しても構わんだろうか？","Now...I'm loath to ask, but would you
mind forking over 20 rupees to cover
some of my costs?"
39,GameInit_02,"かたじけないな
この対価に見合う鍛錬となることを約束しよう","Much obliged, young man. I guarantee
my drills are worth twice what you pay."
40,GameInit_04,"青年よ…""今一度懐具合を確認してから
私に話しかけてはくれないだろうか…","Young man... A straight shooter checks
his wallet before he antes up, not after.
Sort yourself out, and come back later."
41,GameInit_05,"善意とて無償ではないのだ…
悪く思わんでくれ","This here's a service I'm happy to
provide, but I can't do it for free.
Don't judge a man for his needs."
42,GameInit_06,"賢明な判断だな
この判断が いつか汝を救うことになるだろう","Good thinking. Keep it up and you might
live to be my age."
43,GameReady_00,それでは少し私について来てくれ,"All right. Then c'mere, young man."
44,GameReady_01,"向こうの浮いている的は見えるな？
あれを弓矢で壊した数で腕前を計るとしよう","You see the targets floating out there?
I'll judge your skill by how many of 'em
you pop with your arrows."
45,GameReady_02,"時間になったら私が声をかけるから
それまでは存分に腕を振るってくれ
言うまでも無いが自分の馬から降りたら中断だ
あくまでも馬術の腕前を見るものだからな","Don't you worry about when time's up.
I'll let you know. Until then, ride hard
and shoot straight.
Suppose this goes without saying,
but you get off your horse, and we're
done here.
No way to practice shooting from
horseback when you're standing around
on foot, after all."
46,GameReady_04,"話が長くなってしまったが私からは以上だ
それでは始めようか""汝の健闘を祈る","Figure I've said my piece now. Time we
got started. Best of luck, young man."
47,GameReady_05,"さて""競技の前に少し説明をさせてくれ",I'll explain a bit before we get started.
48,GameReady_06,さて競技の説明は必要か？,"You need a refresher on how this drill
works?"
49,GameReady_07,"それでは始めようか""汝の健闘を祈る","Figure it's time we got started. Best of
luck, young man."
50,GameResult_00_00,"ふむ…個か…
あまり芳しい腕前とは言えぬな
まずは常歩や速歩といった速さで
馬に慣れるところから始めてはどうかな？","Hm... You only hit ...
Nothing to write home about.Might want to shoot from a trot some
more before you jump straight into
firing at a gallop."
51,GameResult_01_00,"ふむ…個か…
下手ではないが この先に行くには不安が残るな
動きながらの弓術は難しいからな
撃つべき的をよく見ることだな
これは私からの餞別だ
精進せよ","Hm... Well, you hit ...
Not bad, but I'm not rightly convinced
you're ready to raise the stakes.
Hitting your mark at a gallop is no small
potatoes. Make sure to keep your eye on
the target.
Here's a reward for seeing it through.
Keep drilling and you'll get it."
52,GameResult_02_00,"ほう…個とは…
なかなかに見込みがありそうだな青年よ
集中すると的が止まって見えると聞くが
汝なら その域に辿り着けるやもしれぬな
これは旅を続ける汝への差し入れだ
どうか役立ててほしい","Hm... targets...
You've got some fire in you, young man.The best archers say targets seem to
freeze when they concentrate on them.
I think you could reach that level too.
Here's a gift to help you on your travels.
Hope you find a good use for it."
53,GameResult_03_00,"むむっ個とは…
若いのに大した腕前だな
む？""若くない？ 100歳を超えている？
ははは""冗談の腕も大したものじゃないか
これは良いものを見せてもらった礼だ
私にはもう不要なものだ遠慮せんでくれ","Hm... targets...
It's been a dog's age since I've seen
such talent in someone so young.
What do you mean you're not that
young? Over 100 years old? Go ahead,
pull the other one.
Anyway, this gift is my thanks for putting
on a good show. I'm past needing it,
and I think you should have it."
54,Halt_00,む？ どうかしたか？,Hm? What's the matter?
55,Halt_01,"そうか…
頂戴した費用は返すことは出来ないがいいか？","That's fair. Course, you won't get your
money back, if that's what you're after.
Still planning to quit?"
56,Halt_02,"うむ ならばよかった
まだ時間はあるぞ最善を尽くしてくれ","Good. No one likes a quitter. There's
still time, so ride hard and shoot straight."
57,Halt_03,"やむを得ない事情があるのだろうな…
汝の無事を祈っているぞ","I suppose you have your reasons.
Hope to see you again someday."
58,Initial,"そこの青年よ""戦いの心得がありそうだが
馬上での戦闘にも自信はあるか？","Hello there, young man. I can tell just
by looking that you're a trained warrior.But tell me this: How confident are you
in your ability to fight on horseback?"
59,MyHouse_00,"では""愛馬との人馬一体の活躍
とくと見せていただこう","Suit yourself. We'll see how well you and
your horse act as a team on the field."
60,Near00,鍛錬せねば,Can't miss my drills today.
61,Near01,うとうと,*snore...*
62,Near02,雨が降ろうとも,"Do your worst, rain."
63,New,"では的の準備をしてくるのでな
このまま しばし待たれよ","I'll go fix up the targets. Shouldn't
be long."
64,New_00,"待たせてしまって悪かったな
それでは鍛錬を再開しようか",All done now. Let's get drilling again.
65,NoHouse,"さて…""見たところ馬には乗っていないようだが
これでは鍛錬を行うことは出来ないな","Now...for a young man interested in
horseback archery, you seem to be in
want of a horse. That's no way to drill."
66,Rain,"こんな雨の日の鍛錬は
厳しいものがあるだろうが精進するがいい","Training on a rainy day like this can be
harsh, but it'll do you a world of good
to tough it out."
67,Re_ask,"さて もう一度問おう
己が力量知りたくはないか？","So I'll ask you again. Don't you want
a chance to prove you're not all talk?"
68,Register_00,うむ それがいいだろう,Sounds like the right call to me.
69,Register_01,"その道に沿って進むと馬宿があったはずだ
そこで登録をしてから""改めて私に話してくれ","Head down that path there, and you
ought to come across a stable.They'll register your horse for you so
you can come back and drill here."
70,Sleep,うむ なんだ夜遅くに…,"Hm? You sure are a night owl,
aren't you?"
71,Talk00,"この鍛錬には弓と矢が必要だ
十分な準備は できているだろうか？
矢は必要であれば売ることもできるが
どうするかね？","Can't drill without a bow and arrows.
I'd think that's just common sense.If you need some, I can sell you a few
of mine. Or I'm open for any sort of
business! What do you say?"
72,Talk03,もう必要なものはないか？,Anything else you need?
73,WhenFallFromHorse_01,"愛馬ともども達者でな
くれぐれも無茶はしてくれるなよ","You and your horse are something else.
Promise me you won't get careless."
74,WildHouse_00,"ふむ…""見たところその馬は
馬宿での登録が まだ済んでいないな？
残念だが登録が済んでいない馬での鍛錬は
認めることが出来んのだよ
このままでは鍛錬にならんが
どうするかね？","Hm... That horse of yours doesn't look
registered to me. Can't have you drill
on an unregistered horse.
Any ideas?"
