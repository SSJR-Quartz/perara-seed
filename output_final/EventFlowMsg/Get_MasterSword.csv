1,Deku_Cancel00,"100年前は軽々と抜いていたというに
随分と衰えたようじゃのう
今より もっと体力をつけることじゃな
ふぉ ふぉ ふぉ","A hundred years ago, you would have
been able to pull out the sword easily.
You have grown weak.
You must find a way to become stronger.
Ho ho ho..."
2,Deku_Cancel01,"まだ体力が足りぬようじゃのう
もう少し修行に励むがいい","It would seem you still lack the
necessary strength for this task. 
You must recommit to your training."
3,Deku_Cancel01_2,"…じゃが今のは惜しかったぞ
ふぉ ふぉ ふぉ","...However, you were quite close this
time. Ho ho ho..."
4,Deku_Cancel02,"ふぉ ふぉ ふぉ
怖気づいたか…
主の体力は とうに 100年前を越えておる
あとは覚悟次第じゃ","Ho ho ho... Why so fearful?


Your strength is greater now than it was
a century ago. All you need now is the
determination to succeed."
5,Deku_Cancel03,"まだ体力が足りぬようじゃのう
…だが修行は十分に励んでおるようじゃな
女神像から頂いた器は二度と変えられない…
そう思ってはおらぬか？
ハイラルの南東 ハテノ村を訪れるがいい
器のやり取りができるものが おるはずじゃ
少しばかり邪なやつじゃがのう…
ふぉ ふぉ ふぉ","You still lack the necessary strength.
But it doesn't look like you lack for
training. No...
Perhaps you imagine...that the
containers given to you by the statues
of the Goddess cannot be changed?
Visit Hateno Village in the southeast of
Hyrule. There you will find one who
trades in such containers.
Though...he is a bit wicked...
Ho ho ho..."
6,Deku_Cancel04,"まだ体力が足りぬようじゃのう
…だが修行は十分に励んでおるようじゃな
主の克服の証を女神像に捧げて
ハートを増やしてみてはどうかのう","You still lack the necessary strength.
But it doesn't look like you lack for
training. No...
Offer a statue of the Goddess your
Spirit Orbs, and try increasing the hearts
that make up your true strength."
7,Deku_Cancel05,"そんな傷を負うた体で抜けるとでも思うたか
まずは傷を癒し万全を期することじゃな","You think you can pull out the sword
while suffering such injuries?! Heal your
wounds first, or you stand no chance."
8,Deku_Cancel06,"ふぉ ふぉ ふぉ

怖気づいたか…
覚悟が出来たら また挑むがいい","Ho ho...


Why so fearful? Come back and try again
once you've found your determination."
9,Deku_Finish01,"その剣の名は…""マスターソード

厄災ガノンや奴の怨念を帯びし者に対した時
聖なる光をまとい真の力を発揮するじゃろう…
だが過信は禁物じゃぞ
無駄に振り回せば傷付き いずれ使えなくなる
…そうなれば剣の回復を待たねばならぬのだ

ガノンを討つのなら その剣にのみ頼るは危険…
万全を期し神獣を解放しておくことじゃ","That blade has a name... 
It is the Master Sword.

When used against Calamity Ganon or
those tainted by his Malice, it will 
become suffused with holy light...
At such times, the true power of the
sword will manifest...but be warned.
Do not rely too much on its power.
If you wield it without need, its power
will be exhausted and it will no longer
be of use to you.
...Should this happen, you must wait for
the sword to recover.

It would be rash to rely on this sword
alone to defeat Ganon... I suggest you
free the Divine Beasts before facing him."
10,Deku_Finish02,"その剣の名は…""マスターソード

…そうなれば剣の回復を待たねばならぬのだ

100年来の主の相棒…大事に使うことじゃ
主を待っておる者の為にもな…","That blade has a name...

It was your partner a century ago...
Use it with care... And wield it bravely
for the one who waits for you..."
11,Deku_FirstFailure01,"剣から手を離さなければ
命を落とすところじゃったぞ…","You would have lost your life if you
hadn't released your grip on the sword..."
12,Deku_FirstFailure02,"次は途中で止めぬぞ
覚悟を決めて挑むがいい","Prepare before you try again...for I will
not stay your hand partway through
the next time."
13,Deku_Talk00,"この剣を抜きたければ
己の真の体力で挑まねばならぬのじゃ
はたして今の主に抜けるかどうか
しかと見とどけさせてもらおう","If you hope to pull the sword from its
resting place, you must use your true
strength.
Let us see whether or not you currently
possess said power."
14,Deku_Talk01,"いくら体力があるように見せかけても
この剣には全てお見通しよ
この剣を抜きたければ
己の真の体力で挑まねばならぬのじゃ
はたして今の主に抜けるかどうか
しかと見とどけさせてもらおう","The sword cares not for your physical
might. It is moved by what lies within.

It cuts through bravado and superficial
enhancements. Only true strength can
draw it from its resting place.
The only way to know if you have what
it takes...is to try."
