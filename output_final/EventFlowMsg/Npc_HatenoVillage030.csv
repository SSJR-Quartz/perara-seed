This old house here has been
abandoned. Everyone in Hateno Village

どんどん雇われるんじゃないかと睨んでるッス","Apparently, your name has to end in
\""son\"" to work at Bolson Construction.

The boss there was saying he's really
looking into expanding the business.

But I'm wondering—just how many folks
are out there with names ending in
