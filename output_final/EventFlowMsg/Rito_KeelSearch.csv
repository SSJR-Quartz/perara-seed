やっぱり兄弟岩にいたみたいね
まったくメドーが鎮まったからって
無茶な子だわ…
でも姉妹仲良く
歌の練習ができたみたいね
ささやかだけど探してくれたお礼
受け取ってくれる？","Thank you for finding Kheel. I'm glad she
was just at Warbler's Nest as I thought.

She thinks she can do whatever she
wants just because Medoh has
been appeased.
But at least she got to practice singing
with her sisters. It's only a small token
of my gratitude, but please, take this."
5,Npc_HighMountain036_F_103,"さて みんなのご飯を作らないと！
5人もいると大変だわ","Well, I should get to cooking. Kheel is
one of five daughters, which means five
mouths to feed. Dinner won't make itself!"

Where are you?!"
9,Npc_HighMountain036_R_001_2,"五女のキールが見当たらないの
どこへ行ったのかしら…","I can't find Kheel anywhere!
Where could she be?"
10,Npc_HighMountain036_R_002,"あんな遠いところへ
ひとりで行ったのかしら…心配だわ…","But that's so far away. Could she
have made it there on her own?
Oh, I'm so worried..."
11,Npc_HighMountain036_R_003,"…まさかキールったら
歌を練習しに兄弟岩へ…？","Maybe she went to Warbler's Nest to
practice her singing..."
12,Npc_HighMountain036_R_004,"…あら？

あなたがキールの言っていた人ね！
キールのわがままを聞いてくれてありがとう
あなたのおかげで姉妹仲良く
歌の練習ができたみたいね
よかったらこれ
お礼にもらってくれないかしら？","Hmm?


Oh, you must be the one Kheel told
me about. Thanks for helping her out.

The girls were able to practice their
singing thanks to you.
Please, take this. As a thank-you."
13,Npc_HighMountain036_R_Near,どこへ行ったの～？,Where did you go?!
