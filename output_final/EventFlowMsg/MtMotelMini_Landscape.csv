1,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Near,……,...
2,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_00,あぁ私もいつか こんな画が描けたら……,I wish I had this kind of artistic skill...
3,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_01,"あ キミもこの画を見に来たのかい？
いやぁ何度見てもすばらしい画だよね！","Have you come to look at this picture
too? It's so beautiful... I could spend
hours just looking at it."
4,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_02,"この画は ココの馬宿の主人
オッズが趣味で描いたらしいんだ
雄大な火山をバックにしつつ さりげなく
ココの馬宿も風景に入ってるだろ？","This painting was made by Ozunda, the
owner of this stable, or so I hear.

That volcano in the background...
It's so majestic. And the stable is subtle
in the scenery."
5,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_03,"南の方から この馬宿を見て描いたんだろうけど
よくこの構図を見つけ出せたもんだよ……","I think the stable was painted from a
southern direction... The composition is
just so impressive..."
6,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_04,"あと この画の左側に祠があるんだけど…
あんなところに祠があるなんて知らなかったな
あんなヘンピそうな場所に祠なんかあったって
誰も行かないだろうに…","Oh... There's a shrine on the left-hand
side of the picture...

I never noticed that shrine before.
I've looked at this painting so much,
and I never noticed it...
Must be because that's an odd place for
a shrine to be located. Who would go to
a shrine there, anyway?"
7,Ready_Npc_DeathMt001_Talk_05,"え？ キミ行ったの？！
そうか行くヤツは どこにあっても行くんだな…","Wait, what? You went there? I guess
for some people, there's nothing to
stop them from traveling the world."
