Only one place you could mean.

The easternmost structure in this village,
at the top of the hill... Yup, you mean the
Hateno Ancient Tech Lab, right?
Its director does \""research\"" there every

but who knows what THAT means!
That director doesn't like kids all that

curious and snoop around a lot..."
