could just take a nice, peaceful trip..."
2,Atacked01,魔物…まだいるみたい？,"The monsters... Looks like there's
still some left."
3,Failed00,"足をひねったかな…
大丈夫だと思うけど","I might have twisted my ankle a little...
But I think I'm OK, overall."
4,Failed01,"ちょっとだけ痛いかも…
歩けないほどじゃないけど","I'm in a little bit of pain... But I can still
walk, for sure."
5,Guardian00,"早く逃げて！
ガーディアンが近づいてきてるから！","Run, quickly! A Guardian is coming
this way!"
6,MSG_Firo_00,"私は龍の伝説を辿る旅をしています
旅人同士…情報交換します？
この辺りは魔物が多い危険地帯…
襲われる前に さっさと通り過ぎるのが賢明かも","I'm on a journey, pursuing the legends
I've heard about dragons. If you're a
traveler like me...
Well, you should know that this region is
full of monsters and is quite dangerous.
It would be wise to pass through quickly."

名前はタツノ龍に魅せられた旅人です
フィローネの森で迷った旅人が
龍の形の川を見たっていう話が気になってて…","What? Me? My name is Totsuna. I'm a
huge fan of pretty much anything and
everything related to dragons!
A traveler who got lost in Faron Woods
said he saw a dragon-shaped river,
which made me really curious..."

10,MSG_Firo_02,"変わり者だって思われそうですけど
私はできれば龍のことだけ考えていたい…
ハイリア湖のほとりで空を見上げると
雲が龍の形に見える時があるんです！","You might find this a bit strange, but if I
could only ever think about dragons,
I absolutely would...
You know, if you stand on the shore of
Lake Hylia and look at the sky, you can
sometimes see dragon-shaped clouds!"
11,MSG_Firo_02_1,"ハイリア湖のほとりで空を見上げると
雲が龍の形に見える時があるんです！","If you stand on the shore of Lake Hylia
and gaze up at the sky, sometimes the
clouds look just like dragons!"
12,MSG_Firo_03,"いきなり龍の話で申し訳ないですけど
私…龍は絶対いるって信じてるの！
「川を架空の生き物に見立てたのが龍であって
実在はしない」って説は荒唐無稽すぎる！","Sorry if I harp on too much about
dragons, but... Well, I just know they
exist! They have to!
\""A dragon-shaped river doesn't prove
that dragons exist!\"" they say...
Pffft! It doesn't prove they don't, either!"
13,MSG_Firo_03_1,"私…龍は絶対いるって信じてるの！

「川を架空の生き物に見立てたのが龍であって
実在はしない」って説は荒唐無稽すぎる！","I...definitely believe that there are
dragons in our world. I'm sure of it!

People can claim they don't exist, but
that won't stop me from believing!"

フィローネ街道を さらに東に進むと
魚がおいしいウオトリー村に行けますよ！","I'm on a journey, pursuing the legends
I've heard about dragons. Since you're
a traveler like me, here's a secret...
If you keep following the Faron Highroad

The fish there... So good!"

17,Near01,龍はきっといる…,I know dragons exist...
18,Near02,龍はどこに…,Where are the dragons?
19,Near03,龍に会いたい…,I want to see a dragon...
20,Near04,雨が降ってきた…,It's started raining...
21,Rest_00,"私の頭の中は龍のことでいっぱい
自分のことながら大丈夫かなって…
空の雲を見ても森の川を見ても稲妻を見ても
龍の姿に見えちゃって…","My head is always so wrapped up in
dragon stuff, I sometimes worry that I
might be a little obsessed...
Oh! Have you ever noticed how, be it
clouds in the sky, rivers in the forest, or
lightning...everything looks dragony?"
22,Rest_01,"雨の日は出歩かずに
伝説の龍に想いを馳せています","When it's all rainy outside, I like to let my
imagination run wild with thoughts of all
the dragon stories I've heard."

26,RetMSG_Firo_01,"私 こう見えても かなり興奮してるんです
なぜかっていうと…
空の雷に森の川や長き道…フィローネ地方には
龍伝説の裏付けになりそうな景観が多いから！","I may not be showing it outwardly, but
I'm really quite excited. This place just
supports dragon theory so well!
Lightning in the sky... Rivers winding
through the landscape... Almost like they
were carved... Faron is amazing!"
27,RetMSG_Firo_01_1,"空の雷に森の川や長き道…フィローネ地方には

フロリア湖の近くでは異様な気配を感じるの
まるで本物の龍がそばにいるかのような…","What? Me? My name is Totsuna. I'm a

あっ伝説の龍の話ですよー
龍を目撃したっていう旅人に話を聞くと
みんながみんな見たのは夜だったって…","I want to see one in person, not just in
my dreams... Oh! I was just talking about

弓で龍を射抜くと
万病に効くウロコが手に入るって言われてて…","Whether this story is true or not is
anyone's guess, but it relates to
dragons, so I love it all the same...
Apparently shooting a dragon with an
arrow will knock a scale free from its
body, and that scale can heal any illness."
