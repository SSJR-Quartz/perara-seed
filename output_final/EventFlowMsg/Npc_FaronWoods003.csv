双子山ってのが載ってるだろ？

水面に映る大きな影を見たって噂があるし
どこまで本当なんだろうな？","So on this map of yours, do you see
Dueling Peaks to the north of here?

Well, apparently that used to be just one
mountain a really long time ago.

The legends say a dragon god split the
mountain in half to forge a way through,
and that's how it went from one to two.
Recently, some are even saying they've
seen the shadow of a large creature on
the surface of Lake Floria!
I wonder if any of that is true..."

Speaking of! Have you heard the story,
buddy? Some say that rumbling sound
is the angry ranting of a dragon god!
But who knows if that's even true.
I've certainly never seen any proof!"
