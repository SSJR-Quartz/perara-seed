","Well, lookee here...


Welcome, Master Link!"
8,talk01,大義である！,Justice at long last!
9,talk02,"あの火山弾のせいで お客さんが減っちゃって
英傑様ごっこでもしてないと ヒマでヒマで…","To be honest, we haven't had too many
visitors here since those magma bombs
started fallin' from the sky.
I'd be bored to tears if I didn't pass the
time pretendin' to greet the long lost
Hylian Champion, heh."
10,talk03,"こんなとこまで
何しに来たゴロ",What brings ya all the way out here?
11,talk04,"ちなみにリンクというのは 100年前町の英傑
ダルケル様と共に戦ったハイリア人ゴロ
詳しい事は奥の組長にでも聞くといいゴロ","Oh, in case ya didn't know, Link is the
little Hylian who fought alongside the
Goron Champion, Daruk.
If ya wanna hear more, talk to the Boss.
He lives further in town."
12,talk06,やぁ気持ちのいい朝ゴロね,"Hey there. Nice day, isn't it?"
13,talk07,やぁ今日も熱いゴロね,Hey there. It's hot out here. Again.
14,talk08,やぁ今日は夜でも熱いゴロね,Hey there. Even the evening is hot...
15,talk12,やぁ,Hey there!
16,talk13,またね～,See ya!
17,talk14,"それはそれは いらっしゃいませ！

この熱さのせいで
ハイリア人は滅多に来ないってのに…
ま ゆっくりしてくといいゴロ","Well, whatever brought ya here doesn't
really matter. Welcome, brother!

Because of this extreme heat, I actually
haven't seen any Hylians around lately...

Welp, their loss! Enjoy your stay,
little guy!"
18,talk15,"商売ゴロか…

確かに昔も今もゴロンシティでは
宝石が よく採れるゴロ
でも宝石なんて ボク達にとっては
ただの固くてマズい食べ物ゴロ
そんな宝石を喜んで買ってくれる
部族が居るゴロ
だから組長とゴロンシティは
結構儲かってるみたいゴロよ","Business, eh?


In the old days, you could easily find
jewels in Goron City. To us, they're just
gross snacks that are hard to eat. Yuck!
Sounds nuts, but lots of people actually
buy those abominations at a high price.
Crazy, I know. But it's true!
I don't get it, but that's why the Boss
and Goron City make lots of money
sellin' that weird food to crazy folks."
19,talk17,"そんなこと いきなり言われても
よく分からんゴロよ…
もっと知りたいなら
ウチの組長を訪ねると いいゴロよ","Huh. Sorry, I don't really know anything
about all that business.

If you're lookin' for info, I bet the Boss
knows a thing or two about it."
20,talk18,"宝石ならデスマウンテンで
いいのが採れるらしいゴロ
最近 みんな近づかなくなったから
勝手に掘っても バレないかもね！","I hear there are some valuable jewels on
Death Mountain.

No one goes near there these days,
so you could probably go dig it all up
without much competition."
21,talk20,"観光はいいけど この熱さ大丈夫？

そんなハイリア人光客のために
それなりの物は売ってるゴロ
防具屋ガッチムッチで
ハイリア人用の耐火防具が売ってるし
それが買えないなら
誰かが燃えず薬を売ってたし…
早く中に入ってチェックするゴロ","Well, just visiting is well and good, but...
can you really bear this heat?

There are some goods that might suit a
Hylian tourist like you.

In fact, fire-resistant armor can
be purchased at a shop called
Ripped and Shredded.
If that doesn't do it for ya, I also saw
someone sellin' fireproof elixir...
You should go check it out."
22,talk21,"そういえばお客さんいい時に来たゴロ！

最近までデスマウンテンをうろついてた
トカゲのバケモノが大人しくなってね
安全になったし
ゆっくりしてくと いいゴロよ
熱いのは相変わらずだけどね…","By the way, mister... I think you came at
a good time!

Ever since that lizard monster lurking on
Death Mountain was tamed, it's safe
again. That means you can take it easy!
Then again, it may be safe, but it's still
pretty darn hot..."
23,talk22,あれ？ さっき「神獣に用」って言ってたような…,"Hm? I thought you said you were here for some
\""divine bees\"" earlier? Maybe I'm crazy..."
24,talk23,あれ？ さっき「観光」って言ってたような…,"Huh? Didn't you say somethin' about being here 
for pleasure before?"
25,talk24,あれ？ さっき「商売で」って言ってたような…,"Huh? Didn't you say somethin' about being here 
for business earlier?"
26,talk25,"シンジューとか よく分からんゴロ…

組長が毎日 アイツを大砲で追っ払ってるから
詳しくは組長に聞いて欲しいゴロ
ちなみに組長ってのは
町の一番奥に住む お爺さんの事ゴロよ","I don't know anything about a
\""diving feast\"" or whatever...

I do know Boss drives a lizard monster
away with a cannon, so you should ask
him if you wanna know more about that.
By the way, Boss is the old guy that lives
in the deepest part of town."
27,talk26,"シンジュー…
ああ トカゲのバケモノのことゴロね
アイツ大暴れして大変だったゴロ！

でも ユン坊が頑張ってくれたおかげで
平和になったゴロ！","The \""divine beat\""? Oh! You mean that
lizard monster, don't you?

That thing caused such a ruckus for us!


Thanks to Yunobo, peace has finally
been restored!"
28,talk27,"そんな事より キミ
さっきの火山弾""大丈夫だったゴロ？","What do ya mean? More importantly,
I hope ya made it past all those
magma bombs without injury!"
