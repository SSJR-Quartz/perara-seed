any interest in something like that."
24,Com_Talk_16,"面倒がるんじゃないよ…
着てる服を売るなんて非常識だろ！","Seriously? I'm already in a bad enough
mood without you making it worse, trying
to sell me the clothes you're wearing..."

それならルピーだよ","Only one?
Let's say... rupees."
26,Com_Talk_34,"を全部買うのかい？

37,Talk_02,"……買うなら一度に全部
買ってほしいもんだがねぇ","If you're going to buy a bunch, you
should just buy them all at once."
38,Talk_03,"ひんやり料理なしで砂漠を渡るのは
命を捨てるようなもんだよ…
にしてもなんで みんな
あんな暑い所に行きたがるのかねぇ…","Trying to cross the desert without using
cooling cooking? That seems like a
foolish thing to do, if you ask me...
And really, what's so amazing about
such a hot place, anyway?"
39,Talk_05,"はぁ…
なんでわざわざ ウチでやるかねぇ…","*sigh*
Why do you come here to do that?"
40,Talk_06,サークサーク…,Sarqso...
41,Talk_07,はぁ… また仕入れとかないとねぇ…,"Ugh, now I've got to go get more...


What a drag..."
42,Talk_09,"終わったかい？

今度からは
ヨソでやってほしいもんだねぇ…","Are you finished?
I wish you would do that somewhere else
next time..."
43,Talk_10,"…ったく こんな夜遅くまで
婆さんを働かせるんじゃないよ","...Ugh, how can they make an old vai work
this late?"
44,Talk_11,"…ん？

ああヴァーサーク…

ヒンヤリメロンの品数なら
ゲルドの街にだって負けやしないよ
どうせなら沢山買っていっとくれ","Huh? Oh, vasaaq...


I've got plenty of hydromelons... I bet 
more than you'll find in Gerudo Town.
Why not buy a bunch while you're here?"
45,Talk_13,どこに足乗せてんだい,Watch it!
46,Talk_14,"ああ アンタかい？
ヴァーサーク…
今はもう売れるもんは残っちゃいないよ

ヒンヤリメロンが欲しいなら
ゲルドの街に行くか
その辺に生えてるのを探すんだね","Oh, it's you. Vasaaq... However, I don't
have anything more I can sell you.

If you want to get hydromelons, you'll
have to go to Gerudo Town. Or find some
growing around this area, I suppose..."
47,Talk_15,"なんだい…
まだアタシに何か用かい？","What do you want? Do you still need
something from me?"
48,Talk_16,……いっそ買い占めてくれたらねぇ,"...You know, if you just bought them all
at once, that would be pretty nice for
me."
49,Talk_17,"ゲルド族の衣装を好んで着るなんざ
アンタも変わった趣味だねぇ
それで まだアタシに何か用かい？","You're an oddball for wanting to wear 
Gerudo outfits... Anyway, you need
anything else from me?"
50,Talk_19,"ん…？

なんだい なんだい？
いかにも「用がある」って顔して","Huh?
What's the matter?

You've got this look on your face that
almost screams, \""I gotta talk to you
right now.\"""
51,Talk_20,"怪しい商人ね…

アタシらからみたら
ゲルド族以外の商人はみんな怪しいってもんさ…
だけど…
そうだね…
最近うろついてる ゲルドの装束を着た
ヴァーイの商人…
アレは なんか裏がある気がするよ

よろず屋に
よく出入りしてるみたいだけどね…
だけど アタシの知ったこっちゃないよ

怪しいもんとは
関わり合いは持ちたくないんでね","A suspicious merchant, huh...


From my point of view, pretty much any
merchant that isn't Gerudo looks
suspicious, you realize?
Still... Yeah, I can think of someone...


That one vai merchant in full Gerudo
garb... She frequents the general store
a lot.
I'm sure there must be more to her story.
But what do I know? Plus, I'm not going
to poke my nose in another's business."
52,Talk_21,"なんだい…用がないなら
「用がある」って顔するんじゃないよ
まぁ…
厄介事を持ち込まれても困るけどねぇ","What's your deal? If you don't need
anything, don't make that \""I need to talk
to you\"" face.
Whatever... I should probably just be
glad I'm not getting dragged into every
little bit of drama."
