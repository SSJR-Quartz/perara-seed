メドーが落ち着いた今
チューリの訓練を再開したんだ
なんだったら チューリに
おまえの弓捌きを見せてやってくれないか？
多少言葉遣いが俺に似てしまったが…
悪気は無いはずだ","It's you... Haven't seen you in a while.
Now that Medoh's calmed down, I've
started training Tulin again.
If you have the time, would you mind
showing Tulin how you handle a bow?He gets his bluntness from me, but he
doesn't mean anything by it. Don't let
whatever he says get to you."
20,talk101,"チューリに おまえの弓捌きを
見せてやってくれないか？
上級者の動きを見て盗む…
そういう訓練も あるはずだからな","Would you mind showing Tulin how you
handle a bow?Watching a master at work and trying to
copy their techniques is a good start
when it comes to training, after all."
21,talk102,"チューリに おまえの弓捌きを見せてやってくれ
何かの参考になるかも知れん","Show Tulin how you handle a bow. It
could set a good example for him."

中止したいなら チューリに話してくれ","Is something wrong? If you want to stop,
then take it up with Tulin."
