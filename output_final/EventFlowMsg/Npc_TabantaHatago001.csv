6,talk_00,"旅の方か
暇を持て余した隠居じいの話を聞くかえ？","A traveler, eh? Can you spare a minute
to listen to a bored, old retiree tell
a story?"
7,talk_02,ハイロ… マリー……,Harry... Mary...
8,talk_03,"この北に広がるタバンタ大雪原を渡った先に
巨大な迷路がある
いつ誰が建てたものかはわからん
大人たちは危ないから近づくなと言っとった
ある日 わしは勇気を試す遊びだと
ハイロを迷路に入らせた
そしてハイロとは それっきりとなってしもうた
本当に危ない場所じゃったんじゃのぅ
子どもというのは まったく無茶をしよるもの…今でも心の痛む思い出じゃ","There's an enormous maze beyond the
Tabantha Tundra just north of here.
I don't know who built it or when.
The adults always said not to go near it.
They said it was too dangerous there.

One day, I urged Harry to go into
the maze as a test of courage.

I...I never saw him again.


I learned the hard way that it really is
dangerous there. Children have no
real sense of danger, I suppose...
To this day, the mere memory breaks
my heart."
9,talk_06,"この歳になると思い出すのは
子どもの頃の思い出ばかりじゃわい
といってもこんな辺境じゃて""子どもは少ない
友だちといえばハイロとマリーだけじゃった
迷路でハイロと遊んだ思い出
遺跡でマリーと遊んだ思い出…","When you get to be my age, you start
reminiscing about all the memories
from your childhood.
Heh, to be honest, growing up out in the
middle of nowhere... Well, there weren't
really other kids around.
My only friends were Harry and Mary.
I remember playing with Harry out in
the maze and Mary out by the ruins..."
10,talk_07,"この馬宿の南東に
大きな谷があるのは ご存じかの？
その谷底には古い古い遺跡があるのじゃが…

いつ誰が建てたものかはわからん
大人たちは危ないから近づくなと言っとった
ある日探検隊と称して わしとマリーは
遺跡を探しに行こうとしたんじゃ
じゃがマリーは足を滑らせて
崖から落ちてしまい それっきりじゃ…
子どもの好奇心は時に取り返しのつかない
ことを引き起こすもんじゃのぅ
いまだに つらい思い出じゃ…","Maybe you've seen the big canyon to
the southeast. There are some secret
ruins down at the base of that valley.
I don't know who built them or when.
The adults always said not to go near.
They said it was too dangerous there.
One day Mary and I went out there to
explore and search for the ruins.

In the blink of an eye, Mary lost her
footing. She slipped and tumbled down
the cliff. I...I never saw her again.
Sometimes a child's innocent curiosity
can cause tragedies that can never be
taken back.
That memory will haunt me until my
dying day..."
11,talk_08,せわしないのぅ,I just can't relax...
12,talk_09,"じゃが まあ そこまで悲しむこともないハイロとマリーは帰ってこんかったが
2匹の子孫が そこの馬小屋におるわい
この辺境で わしの友だちは
馬たちだけじゃったからのぅ","As I grew older, I learned to overcome
my grief over losing them. You can't
change the past, only the future.
Harry and Mary never made it back,
but two of their descendants are in
that stall over there.
My only friends out in these parts were
horses, you see. I suppose that's still
true to this day."
