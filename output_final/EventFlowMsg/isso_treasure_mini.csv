6,NewText_01,"男に教えるのは気が乗らないが…

この川底に何か見えるの分かる？

俺の勘が正しければ
形状からして宝箱で間違いないんだが
どうやって引き上げればいいのか悩んでてな

何かこう…機械か何かで
引き上げられないもんかね","I can't believe I'm about to share this
with you, but I'm absolutely stumped.

Have you seen that strange shape down
at the bottom of the river?

It's hard to make out, but I'm pretty sure
it's a treasure chest.

But I can't figure out how to fish it out of
there.

I guess I need...some kind of machine or
something to get it out."

used, but that's incredible!

And...yeah! What was inside the
treasure chest?"

water..."
12,NewText_11,"中身は何なのか…
気になって眠れねーよ ちきしょー","I'm so curious about what's inside that
chest, I can't even sleep."

I'd be rich! And the ladies would be
tripping over each other to be with me!"

work with that chest. At least I can
sleep now."
