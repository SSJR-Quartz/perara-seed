9,talk00,おはよう,Morning!
10,talk01,こんにちは！,Hello!
11,talk02,こんばんは,Good evening!
12,talk04,"キミも この山麓の馬宿に立ち寄ってる って事は
これから ゴロンシティに向かうの？","If you're stopping by Foothill Stable,
then you're probably headed to
Goron City?"
13,talk05,だろうと思った,I thought so.
14,talk06,"そっか…ま

キミがどこに行こうと知ったこっちゃないけど
ゴロンシティだけは気を付けたほうがいいよ
あそこは「暑い」と言うより 「熱い」から","Oh, OK...


But if you do ever decide to head to
Goron City, you'd better take care.
It's really hot there.
Well, \""hot\"" doesn't really do it justice.
It's more like...it'll burn the flesh from
your bones...and then burn those too."
15,talk07,あぁ…,Ah...
16,talk08,"それにしても…キミ…
そんな格好でゴロンシティに行くつもり？","Hold on... Buddy, are you really headed
to Goron City dressed like that?"
17,talk09,"これだから素人は…

あそこは絶壁も多いし二合目からは
体が燃えちゃうくらい「熱い」のよ？
…","See...this is how tourists get a bad rep.


That place is sheer cliff after sheer cliff,
and it gets so hot past the second
checkpoint that your body will catch fire."
18,talk10,"だって キミの耐火対策見りゃ分かんじゃん

それならゴロンシティに たどり着けるかもね
健闘を祈るよ","You've clearly taken precautions to deal
with the burning air up there.

You MIGHT just be able to reach
Goron City. Best of luck."
19,talk11,"…そうだろうなぁ

そんな耐火対策じゃゴロンシティに行くまでに
焼け死ぬだろうし","Good to hear.


If you tried to get to Goron City dressed
like that, you'd be burned alive faster
than you can say \""Hylian barbecue.\"""
20,talk12,"そうか

それなら悪い事は言わない
ゴロンシティに行くのは あきらめな","I see.


I won't waste my breath arguing about
it. Just trust me when I say you should
give up on going to Goron City."
21,talk13,"あら…？
キミルピーが足りないようね
その辺に転がってる素材とか売って
金策して来なさい","Hmm... Looks like you're broke.
Maybe sell some of the junk in your bag
to get some rupees."
22,talk14,オッケーじゃ これが燃えず薬,All right. Here is your fireproof elixir.
23,talk16,"あら…？
キミ持ち物がいっぱいじゃない？
要らない物は売るなり捨てるなりしなさい","Huh?
Looks like your inventory is full.
Get rid of some of that junk first."
24,talk17,はいじゃコレ,OK. Here you go.
25,talk18,"ゴロンシティに行くなら
私の燃えず薬売ってあげようか？","If you're headed to Goron City, I'll sell
you some of my fireproof elixirs."
26,talk19,"ん…まぁでも
",Hmm...
27,talk20,"燃えず薬""結構持ってるみたいだし
ゴロンシティまでなら なんとかなるかもね","It looks like you already have a bunch of
fireproof elixirs. You should be able to
make it to Goron City."
28,talk21,"ゴロンシティまでは旅慣れた人でも
最低3個は持ってくよ","Even Goron City regulars usually take
at least three elixirs with them."
29,talk23,"燃えず薬
欲しけりゃ売ってあげようか？","If you want to buy some fireproof elixir,
just let me know."
30,talk24,"1個60ルピー 2個だと110ルピー
3個だと150ルピーだけど買う？","It's 60 rupees for one, 110 rupees for
two, and 150 rupees for three. Buying
in bulk pays off here!"
31,talk25,"それだけ持ってたら
ゴロンシティまでなら大丈夫かもね","If you have that many, you should be
able to make it to Goron City no problem."
32,talk26,もっと買ってった方が身のためだと思うな,"You know what they say though...
\""Hope for the best.
Prepare for the worst.\"""
33,talk27,"キミのその耐火対策なら
ゴロンシティに たどり着けるかもね","With fireproofing like that, you should be
able to make it to Goron City."
34,talk28,"キミのその耐火対策なら
ゴロンシティに たどり着けるかもね
健闘を祈るよ","With fireproofing like that, you should be
able to make it to Goron City.

Good luck."
35,talk29,"ま""私の持ってる燃えず薬があれば
話は別なんだけど","Of course, it would be a completely
different story..."
36,talk30,"ま キミの事なんか知ったこっちゃないけど
死なれちゃ困るし…
全く…しょうがないな

少なくとも この燃えず薬を使えば「熱さ」は
しのげるしよかったら売ってあげようか？","Normally I wouldn't stop a stranger from
heading to their doom, but I kinda
like ya.
So I guess I have no choice but to sell
you these fireproof elixirs. They can
protect you from the burning air."
37,talk31,"もっと欲しかったら
売ってあげるから声かけてよね","I can sell you more if you need them.
Just come and talk to me."
38,talk32,"なんなら私の持ってる燃えず薬
売ってあげようか？","In any case, do you want me to sell
you some of my fireproof elixir?"
39,talk33,"燃えず薬""欲しかったら
売ってあげるから声かけてよね","If you have some of this fireproof elixir
that I'm selling."
