8,Diary_01,"英傑達との会合の後遺物調査に向かうも
今日の発掘では大きな成果を得られなかった
厄災が復活を迎える迄に遺物の全てを理解し
迎撃の準備を整えねばならない
占い師の予言が現実になるのなら
あまり時間は残されていない筈だ…
考えを廻らせていると不安ばかり襲ってくる
今夜は もう休もう
追記：明日御父様の指名で彼が私付の騎士に
着任する…","After meeting with the Champions, I left
to research the ancient technology, but
nothing of note came of my research.
The return of Ganon looms—a dark force
taunting us from afar. I must learn all I
can about the relics so we can stop him.
If the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be
believed, there isn't much time left...

Ah, but turning over these thoughts in
my head puts me ill at ease. I suppose
I should turn in for the night.
P.S. Tomorrow my father is assigning
HIM as my appointed knight..."
9,Diary_02,"神獣 ヴァ・ルーダニア調整の為 ゴロンシティへ
…背後にずっと彼の視線を感じ疲労を覚えた
初めて会った時から感じてはいたけれど
彼は本当に無口で何を考えているか分からない
お蔭で余計な想像をしてしまう…退魔の剣に
選ばれた彼は私の事をどう思っているのだろう
ハイラル王家の娘に生れながら封印の力を
使えない私を…彼は蔑んでいないだろうか？","I set out for Goron City today to
make some adjustments to
Divine Beast Vah Rudania.
I still recall feeling his eyes on me as I
walked ahead. The feeling stayed with
me so long, I grew anxious and weary.
It is the same feeling I've felt before in
his company... And still, not a word
passes his lips.
I never know what he's thinking! It makes
my imagination run wild, guessing at
what he is thinking but will not say.
What does the boy chosen by the sword
that seals the darkness think of me?
Will I ever truly know?
Then, I suppose it's simple. A daughter
of Hyrule's royal family yet unable to
use sealing magic... He must despise me."
10,Diary_03,"今日彼に酷い事を言ってしまった

調査の成果が上がらず滅入っていた時に何度も
同行を断った彼が現れ思わず叫んでしまった
でも私が何故怒っているか分からない様子だった
申し訳無いけれど そういう処は苛立ちを覚える","I said something awful to him today...


My research was going nowhere. I was
feeling depressed, and I had told him
repeatedly not to accompany me.
But he did anyway, as he always does,
and so I yelled at him without restraint.

He seemed confused by my anger. I feel
terribly guilty...and that guilt only makes
me more agitated than I was before."
11,Diary_04,"今日は日録を どう書いていいのか判らない
自分の気持ちが上手く文章にならない
彼が私を助けてくれた
イーガ団の刃から私を護ってくれた
私は散々彼を邪険にしてきたのに
自分勝手な苛立ちを彼にぶつけてきたのに
明日今までの事を謝ろうと思う
そして彼と… リンクと少し話をしてみよう","I am unsure how to put today's events
into words. Words so often evade me
lately, and now more than ever.
He saved me. Without a thought for his
own life, he protected me from the
ruthless blades of the Yiga Clan.
Though I've been cold to him all this
time...taking my selfish and childish
anger out on him at every turn...
Still, he was there for me. I won't ever
forget that. Tomorrow, I shall apologize
for all that has transpired between us.
And then...I will try talking to him.
To Link. It's worth a shot."
12,Diary_05,"リンクと少しずつ話が出来る様になってきた
実は彼は健啖家で何でも美味しく食べるそうだ
思い切って なぜ普段は無口なのかと尋ねると
リンクは言い難そうにしていたが答えてくれた
何かと他人に注目される彼は常に模範足れと
意識し やがて感情を表に出せなくなったという
私は彼を才能に恵まれ苦悩とは縁が無い人だと
思い込んでいたが そんな事は無かったのだ
どんな人にも他人からは見えない悩みがある…
私は自分に精一杯で そんな事も分からなかった
もっとリンクと話をして もっと想いを聞きたい
そして私の悩みを彼に打ち明けられたら と思う","Bit by bit, I've gotten Link to open up
to me. It turns out he's quite a glutton.
He can't resist a delicious meal!
When I finally got around to asking why
he's so quiet all the time, I could tell it
was difficult for him to say. But he did.
With so much at stake, and so many eyes
upon him, he feels it necessary to stay
strong and to silently bear any burden.
A feeling I know all too well... For him,
it has caused him to stop outwardly
expressing his thoughts and feelings.
I always believed him to be simply a
gifted person who had never faced a
day of hardship. How wrong I was...
Everyone has struggles that go unseen
by the world... I was so absorbed with
my own problems, I failed to see his.
I wish to talk with him more and to see
what lies beneath those calm waters,
to hear him speak freely and openly...
And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare
my soul to him and share the demons
that have plagued me all these years."
13,Diary_06,"御父様に もう遺物研究に関わるな と厳命された
封印の力を得る為の修行に専念しろと
悔しくて情けなくて言葉が出なかった
幼い頃からずっと…私は やってきたのに
修行を始める前年御母様が急逝した…
私は母と師を同時に失ってしまった
御母様は笑顔で言っていた…大丈夫 ゼルダ
貴女なら直ぐに出来る様になる… と
でも私は出来なかった…何度やっても何時まで
経っても…封印の力を宿している筈なのに
明日はリンクと力の泉へ修行に赴く予定だ
でも また徒労に終わるのだろう… きっと…","Father scolded me again today. He told
me I am to have nothing more to do with
researching ancient technology.
He insisted that I focus instead on
training that will help me awaken
my sealing magic.
I was so frustrated and ashamed I could
not even speak. I've been training since
I was a child, and yet...
Mother passed the year before my
training was to begin. In losing her,
I lost not just a mother, but a teacher.
Mother used to smile and tell me,
\""Zelda, my love, all will be well in
the end. You can do anything.\""
But she was wrong. No matter how I try
or how much time passes...the sealing
power that is my birthright evades me.
Tomorrow I journey with Link to the
Spring of Power to train. But this, too,
will end in failure. Such is my curse."
14,Diary_07,"昨晩夢を見た…闇に覆われた場所で
光に包まれた一人の女性が私を見つめていた
彼女は人ではない…私は そう直感した
精霊か女神か よく判らないが とても美しかった
彼女の唇は動いていたが声は届いて来なかった
聖なる力を持っていれば聞く事が出来たのか
それともあれは私の悩みが生み出した只の夢か
…答えは直否応無しに出る筈だ…","I had a dream last night... In a place
consumed by darkness, a lone woman
gazed at me, haloed by blinding light.
I sensed she was...not of this world.
I don't know if she was a fairy or a
goddess, but she was beautiful.
Her lips spoke urgently, but her voice
did not reach me. Would I have heard
her if my power was awoken?
Or was my dream simply a manifestation
of my fears? I am sure I will know the
answer soon, whether I wish to or not..."
15,Diary_08,"今日私は17歳になった
知恵の泉での修行が許される日を迎えたのだ
リンクが迎えに来たら ラネール山へ出立する
他の英傑達は麓まで同道してくれるそうだ
あれ以来御父様とは顔を合わせていないが…
まだ気まずい… ここへ戻った時会いに行こう
……
……
実は あの夢を見てから感じている事がある
無才の姫の言葉など誰も信じはしないだろうが
私は今途方も無く強い胸騒ぎを覚えている","I turned 17 today. That means this is the
day I will finally be allowed to train at the
Spring of Wisdom.
When Link arrives, we will set out for
Mount Lanayru. The other Champions
will accompany us there.
I have not seen my father since he last
scolded me. Things are too strained
now... I will meet with him when I return.
...


Actually...I've had a horrible feeling ever
since that weird dream. No one would
believe a failure of a princess, but...
Right now, for no particular reason, I am
filled with a strange and terrible certainty
that something awful is about to happen."
