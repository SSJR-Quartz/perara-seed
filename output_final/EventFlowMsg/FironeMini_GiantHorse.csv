6,Near00,巨大な…,So...big...
7,Near01,うとうと,Zzz...
8,Near02,おおぉ,Ohhh...
9,Near03,やあやあ,Hey there!
10,talk00,"やあやあ！
こんなところで人に会うなんて珍しいな
僕たちは
野生動物の生態調査をしているものでね
この地方には他では見られない
巨大な馬が生息しているって話を聞いて
その調査のために ここまで来たのさ","Hey there! It's not every day that I see
someone all the way out here!

We're doing an ecological study on the
wild animals in the area.

We'd heard that there was a giant horse
living in this region. Apparently it
can't be found anywhere else...
That was all we needed to hear!
We headed this way to investigate
right away!"
11,talk01,"その馬は… でかいな…

見たことのない大きさだよ！
これは完全に固有種だね","That horse... It's huge...


I've never seen one that big! That is
definitely an endemic species!"
12,talk02,"どうだい？巨大馬の調査
協力してくれる気になったかい？","Well? What do you say? Are you willing
to help us investigate these stories of a
giant horse?"
13,talk03,これは調査に協力してくれたお礼だ！,"This is to thank you for helping with our
investigation!"
14,talk04,"それはもう大きな馬だって話だ
他の地方にはいない固有種の可能性が高い
しかし この先は魔物が多くてね…
なかなか調査が進まずに困っているのさ","The really big horse in this region is
likely part of a rare, local species.

However, with all the monsters roaming
around, we simply can't go any farther.
To be so close to discovery..."
15,talk05,"こんなに大きな馬がいるとはね
驚きだよ！","To think that there is actually a horse
this big out there. How surprising!"
16,talk06,助かるよ！,"Ah, you're a lifesaver!"
17,talk07,"そうか仕方ないな…

まあ気が向いたら
また声をかけてくれよ！","I see. Well... Oh, well, then...


If you change your mind, come back and
talk to me again!"
18,talk08,"どうだい？
巨大馬の調査は進んでいるかい？","How's it going? Have you made progress
in studying the giant horse?"
19,talk09,"巨大馬は ここから西に向かって奥に行った
オブババ草地 あたりに生息しているって話だ","They say that the giant horse lives
around the Taobab Grassland... That'd
be northwest of here."
20,talk10,"じゃあ捕まえて ここに連れてきてくれるか
無理はせずにな！","Do you think you could catch it and
bring it back here? Don't stress out
over the request, though!"
21,talk11,なんだ こんな夜中に…,What do you want at this hour?
22,talk12,"今日は もう遅い
今晩は ここで休んでいったら どうだい？","It's gotten really late. Why not rest for
the night, hmm?"
23,talk13,"そう…
特に馬の化け物みたいなのが いてね…
最初は そいつが探している巨大馬だと思って
近づいたら ひどい目にあったよ
見たところ君は冒険者だろう？
なかなか強そうだ
どうだろう僕たちの代わりに
巨大馬を捕まえてきてくれないかな？","That's right... There was even a monster
that looked quite a lot like a horse...

I approached it, thinking at first that it
was the giant horse we've been looking
for, but... Oh, it was terrible...
Just from looking at you, I'd guess that
you're an adventurer, right?
You certainly look strong.
Hrm... Hey, how would you like to go and
catch a giant horse for us?"
24,talk14,"いやあ""僕たちは
野生動物の生態調査をしているものでね
まさに この巨大馬の調査のために
ここまで来たのさ
しかし助かったよ！
君のおかげで苦労せず巨大馬に会えた","Hey, we're out here doing an
ecological study on the wildlife of
this area.
Specifically, we're here to look into
reports of a giant horse.

And you brought it right to us! Thanks
to you, we were able to meet the giant
horse without having to search!"
25,talk15,"すまないが その馬を
じっくり調べさせてくれないか？","Sorry, but can I take a good look
at that horse?"
26,talk16,じゃあ失礼するよ,"Thanks, I'll be right back."
27,talk17,ふむふむ これはすごい,Hrmmm. This is impressive.
28,talk18,"いやあ これだけ調べられれば十分だ
必要な情報は しっかり取れた
やはり直接この目で確認できると違うね
全て君のおかげだよ！","Wow. With this much info, I can feel my
spirit for discovery murmuring in
contentment.
It's definitely different, seeing something
with your own eyes rather than just
reading about it. Thank you!"
29,talk19,ほほ～実に興味深い,"Ah, hmm. Quite interesting."
