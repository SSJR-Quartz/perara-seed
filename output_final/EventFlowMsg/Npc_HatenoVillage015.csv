5,near00,！！,...Whuh!
6,near01,ふぁぁ…,*yawn...*
7,near02,…ンだよ,Whatcha want?
8,talk00,だ…誰だっ？！怪しいヤツめ！,"Who are you?! Be on your way, you...
suspicious man!"
9,talk02,"あれ？その青い炎""見た事あるぜ？

確かプルアの婆さんが
自分の家まで よく運んでたような…","Huh? I've seen that blue flame before.


I'd see that old woman Purah carrying it
up to her place all the time..."
10,talk03,"その青い炎""プルアの婆さんのだろ？
俺との無駄話はいいから早く届けてやんなよ","That blue flame is for Purah, right?
Then stop wasting time chatting with me
and deliver it! Quickly."
11,talk04,"あれ？その青い炎""見た事あるぜ？

確か研究所の所長さんが
自分の家まで よく運んでたような…","Huh? I've seen that blue flame before.


I used to see the director of the 
research facility carrying it up the hill
all the time."
12,talk05,"その青い炎…""所長さんのだろ？
俺との無駄話はいいから早く届けてやんなよ","That blue flame is for the director, right?
Then stop yapping with me and deliver it

13,talk07,"もう行っていいぜ
旅の途中で寄ったんだろ？
だいたいのモンならよろず屋でそろうだろうし
宿屋なら奥にあるからよ","You're free to go. We're just a waypoint
on your winding road, huh? 

Ah, the life of a traveler. Well, you can
get most things you need at the general
store, and the inn is just back there."
14,talk08,ふぁぁぁ…眠ぃ,Phwaaa... So sleepy.
15,talk09,まだ俺に用か？,You still need something?

17,talk11,はいよ,"Go on, then."
18,talk12,"ヤだよ！
俺は見張り番だ！ ヒマじゃねえんだ！
……

怒ったりして悪かった

この村は平和だから たしかに俺はヒマだ

でも ヒマ人イコール案内上手だと思ったら
大間違いだぜ…
ソテツっていう恰幅のいいオヤジを探してみな
案内したくて ウズウズしてるはずだ","Not likely! I'm on guard duty, Buster!
Serious business! No time for tours!

Grumble...


Sorry for the yelling...and the grumbling.


This village is pretty peaceful, so it's not
like guard duty is all that harrowing.

But you're GRAVELY mistaken if you 
think people with free time are itching to
give village tours.
Try looking for a burly old guy called
Seldon. He'll probably fall all over
himself to show you around."
19,talk13,"ここは緑と染物の町 ハテノ村だ

村なのに町ってヘンだったか…まあいいや

野菜がうまくて空気もうまくて…
あとはえーと… いろいろだ
旅の人は金を使ってくれるから
村の衆は おおむね大歓迎！
…だけど","This is the town of greenery and dyes, 
Hateno Village.

Can a place be a village AND a town? Anyway...


The vegetables taste good. The air smells
good... What else... All kinds of points
of interest I'm forgetting...
Travelers tend to spend their money
here, so that's good! Yeah! The village
folk welcome THAT with open arms!
But..."
20,talk15,"だ…誰だっ？！
こんな時間に怪しすぎるぞ！","Who... Who are you?! I demand answers!
If you're up this late, you're probably
up to no good!"
21,talk16,待て待て待て！,"Wait, wait, wait!"
22,talk17,"…ん？

よく見たら俺たちと同じ
ハイリア人じゃねえか","Hrm? 


You certainly do appear to be a Hylian
like the rest of us..."
23,talk18,"ハイリア人に悪いやつは あんまりいねえ
騒ぎ立てて悪かった…","Hylians are generally good folk, so...
Sorry for getting all worked up..."
24,talk19,"村の一番奥の建物には近づくな
小うるさい婆さんが居るからな","A little advice? Don't go near the place
up the hill in the rear of the village.
There's a yappy old woman there."
