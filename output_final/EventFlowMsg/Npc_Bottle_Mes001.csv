11,talk09,"あぁ…キミか

それから フィネさんの事なんだけど
僕 えらく気に入られてしまったようなんだ
それにしても子供だったなんて…

いやいや あれだけ立派な文章を書けるんだから
将来はきっと素敵な女性になるはずさ","Oh. It's you.


I somehow made it to Zora's Domain.


About Finley... It seems she's taken
quite a liking to me.

As I somewhat expected, she's a young
woman of a Zora who is waaaay older
than me. And wiser. How confusing.
But her writing is so splendid... I don't
care about her being so much older
than I am.
In fact, I'm sure she'll only become more
lovely with every passing year!"
12,talk10,"ゾーラの里は落ち着いてて いい所だね
フィネさんのためにも慣れていこうと思うよ","Zora's Domain is a peaceful place,
isn't it? I think I can get used to
it here. I must...for Finley's sake."
13,talk11,"フィネさんと話ししてると
本業を忘れそうだよ
よろず屋で目利きの練習をしないと…","When I'm chatting with Finley, I almost
forget all about my work.

I need to get back to studying, though.
I wanna learn everything about the trade
and be a real asset to the general store!"
14,talk12,"今から よろず屋へ行くんだ

目利きの練習は毎日しとかないと…
一応は行商人だしね","I'm on my way to the general store now.


I've got to study up and learn everything
about my trade... Otherwise I'm just a
common peddler!"
15,talk13,"ゾーラの里は流石に魚が新鮮だね

行商の先輩 フタバさんは
何を仕入れるのかな…","The fish in Zora's Domain are
really fresh, aren't they?

I wonder what my mentor, Douma,
will have in stock today..."
16,talk14,"岩塩とかはともかく…
ハイラル米は買い…かな","I do need some rock salt... 
While I'm at it, I should pick up
some Hylian rice too."
