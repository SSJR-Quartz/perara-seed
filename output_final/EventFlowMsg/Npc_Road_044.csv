50,MSG_Ichika_00,"さすらいの料理人 マッツをお探しで？
だったら俺だ よく見つけたなハッハッハ
俺は今ミナッカレ馬宿からイチカラ村まで
食材を探して旅をしているんだ","Are you looking for the traveling chef
called Stamm? It's your lucky day!
He is me! Ha ha ha!
I'm currently looking for the ultimate
ingredients from South Akkala Stable
to Tarrey Town."
51,MSG_Ichika_00_1,"ミナッカレ馬宿からイチカラ村を往復して
究極の食材を探してるんだ","I'm looking for the ultimate ingredients

52,MSG_Ichika_01,"誰が呼んだか さすらいの料理人…
ああ俺が自分で呼んだのかハッハッハ
料理ってのは組み合わせを考えるのが
楽しいし有意義なんだな
例えば手足の疲れを回復させたいときは
ガンバリバチのハチミツと リンゴ…とかな","When people call for the traveling chef,
Stamm appears!! Whoopsie, did I just
call for myself? Ha ha ha!
What I'm trying to do is create a dish
that anyone would desperately crave
whether they know it or not.
For example, if they're feeling sluggish,
courser bee honey and an apple are just
the ticket."
53,MSG_Ichika_01_1,"例えば手足の疲れを回復させたいときは
ガンバリバチのハチミツと リンゴだよ","If you're feeling sluggish,

apple are just the ticket."

肉料理は体力回復の効果が大きい
魚料理は特殊能力が最初からついている
それぞれの利点を生かして
いまの自分の体がほしがる料理を作ることだ","I'm the traveling chef, Stamm!


Meat dishes give you loads of energy!
And fish dishes are just plain special!

Take advantage of each ingredient when 
cooking so you can make what your body
needs most!"
55,MSG_Ichika_02_1,"肉料理は体力回復！魚料理は特殊能力！
覚えておくといいぞ","Meat dishes are a great pick-me-up! 
Fish dishes are yummy and special!
These are good things to keep in mind!"
56,MSG_Ichika_03,"あんたは冒険家だな？
だとしたら栄養補給は重要だな
秘境に食材の店はないだろうし
専任の料理人が同行してるわけでもない
俺があんたの親だったら
あんたの食生活が心配になるだろうな","You're an adventurer, aren't you?
Well then! You need to stock up
on some healthy foods! 
Think about it—when you're in the
middle of nowhere, there aren't a lot of
shops selling quality ingredients.
I'm willing to guess you don't have
cooks that follow you around making you
tasty treats. Nail on the head, hm?"
57,MSG_Ichika_03_1,"俺があんたの親だったら食生活が心配になるが
顔色を見れば だいたいわかるぞ
あんたは まあまあうまくやっている
だけど もっとうまくやれるはずだな","If you were my kid, I'd worry endlessly
about your health. Oh, but one glance at
your face tells me how you're doing...
You're so-so right now. But you can
do better! Ha ha ha!"
58,MSG_Ichika_04,"俺は さすらいの料理人 マッツだ
少し偉そうだが実際少し偉いのでしかたない
よく空腹が一番のスパイスだなんて言うが
だったら俺たち料理人はハラペコには敵わない
なにくそ！と俺なんかは思うね","I'm the traveling chef, Stamm! I may
sound a tad arrogant, but I'm very
important, so what can be done?
They say that hunger is the best sauce...
or is it love? I forget.

But that means us cooks will never be
better than a starving chef or a fool
in love. I think that's bogus!"
59,MSG_Ichika_04_1,"空腹が一番のスパイスだとか
料理は愛情などと言うが…
それでも マッツさんの料理には敵わないと
言わせるまで料理人としてがんばるつもりさ！","They say that hunger is the best sauce...
or it might have been love, I dunno.

Regardless, I intend to make people say
nothing can compete with Stamm's food!
I won't stop until I succeed!"

the best ingredients. 

That's why I go back and forth between 
South Akkala Stable and Tarrey Town!
I sell stuff too, so hit me up anytime!"
66,Rest_01,"雨は緑を育み緑は動物を育む
俺の料理は人を育み食べた人の代金が俺を育む
そういうことだな ハッハッハ！","The rain helps grow lots of green plants!
Green plants help animals, and all of
that helps me too!
My dishes help people, and the money
I get from selling them helps me more!
It's a beautiful world, ha ha ha!"

しばらくここで雨宿りするか","I don't want to get my ingredients wet...
Maybe I'll just stay here until the rain 
clears up!"

ちなみに この世界では
虫を使ったものは料理ではなく薬になる
料理人と虫は あまり縁がないんだな
虫嫌いの俺には いいことだハッハッハ","I'm the traveling chef, Stamm! I believe
everything is an ingredient waiting
to happen.
However, in reality, it's not always that
simple. If I tried to stew a leather shoe
and serve it, I bet it wouldn't go well.
Even so, I'm not giving up! "
69,RetMSG_Ichika_00_1,"この世界では
虫を使ったものは料理ではなく薬になる
料理人と虫は あまり縁がないんだな
虫嫌いの俺には いいことだ","When you use bugs and monster parts
to cook, what you end up with are elixirs.

Chefs don't usually deal with bugs.
That's perfect for someone like me
who's terrified of them!"
70,RetMSG_Ichika_01,"この街道の南には
アッカレ湖が広がっていてね実にすばらしい！
いやいや景色の話じゃなくて
湖で泳いでいる食材たちの話さ
だって景色は食えないだろ？ハッハッハ","Just south of this road, you'll find
Lake Akkala! It's great! Oh, whoa.
I'm not talking about the view.
I'm talking about the ingredients that are
swimming in the lake. I mean, come on.
You can't eat a view, right? Ha ha ha!"
71,RetMSG_Ichika_01_1,"アッカレ湖には よい食材が
おいしそうに泳いでいるんだ
食材が生えてたり落ちてたり飛んでたり…
俺にとっては市場みたいな土地だよ ここは","Lake Akkala has great ingredients just
swimming around in all their glory
and deliciousness!
There are also ingredients that grow
there, and those that have fallen there,
and those that fly around there...
To me, the world is a giant market!"

ミナッカレ馬宿で待ってるんだったハッハッハ","I'm the traveling chef, but...
I'm not always traveling.

There are times when I need to take a
break from life on the road.

sounds nice...but I have customers
waiting at South Akkala Stable! Ha ha ha!"

料理があるから旅を続けられるってわけだ","I can't seem to make the dishes I picture
in my head... Blah, what happened to
my inspiration?!
At times like this, I always say...
nothing beats eating a delicious meal!

It not only heals your heart and soul,
it can also make you heat, cold, shock,
or fire resistant! Or even stealthier!
Dishes are the best! Thanks to cooking,
I can move forward in life! I'm so glad I
became a cook in this crazy world. Ha!"
