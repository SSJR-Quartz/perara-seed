1,"""0000""",ラムダの財宝って？,So... Misko's treasure?
2,"""0001""",わかった,I...see.
3,"""0002""",払う,Deal!
4,"""0003""",払わない,No way!
5,Talk00,ちょっと待て ブリセン,Prissen! Hang on!
6,Talk01,"…それでさ兄さん
ラムダの財宝のありかなんだけどさ…","I've got the scoop on Misko's treasure,
and it's great! Listen up, Dak..."
7,Talk02,"おい ブリセン
しゃべりすぎだぜ！",Prissen! You're going to give it all away!
8,Talk03,"ご…ごめんよ兄さん
…つい","Sorry, Dak... I got carried away."
9,Talk04,"とにかく俺たちは大事な話をしてるんだ
何か用があるなら他の奴らをあたってくれよ","Anyway, we're busy here, dude.
If you need something, take it up
with someone else."
10,Talk05,"なんだ？
弟が言ったことなら忘れるんだな","You again? Pay no mind to my little bro's
chatter from before. He's got a penchant
for running his mouth with crazy talk."
11,Talk06,"チッ…
ごまかせなかったか…","Ahhh shoot. Welp. Can't say I didn't try
to throw him off..."
12,Talk07,"それでいい…ラムダの財宝は大物トレジャー
競争相手は少ない方がいいからな","Anyway. Misko's treasure—not that we
were talking about such a thing—is only
for the BEST of treasure hunters. 
That probably rules you out, bub.


The fewer people after it, the better.
And we've still got the scoop!"
13,Talk08,"兄さん話してもいいんじゃないかな
僕たちでもなかなか解けない謎なんだ
こんな素人に
どうせあの謎はわかりっこないよ","Hey, Dak... Why don't we just tell him?
Maybe he'll leave us alone if we do.

I mean, if we can't figure this riddle out,
there's no way someone like him will be
able to."
14,Talk09,…そうだな…,"...That's a good point.

"
15,Talk10,へへっ確かに,Heh. Good deal.
16,Talk11,"金がないヤツには用はない
まっ あきらめるんだな","Well, I've got nothing to say to some
bum without even two rupees to rub
together."
17,Talk12,兄さん やったね！,"Way to go, Dak. You did it!"
18,Talk13,"ラムダは宝の隠し場所を
暗号にして残してたって話さ
ラムダの手下だったヤツの
子孫の親戚から聞いたんだ確かなネタだぜ！","Misko hid the location of the treasure in
some kind of strange secret code.

I heard this from a former dog walker of
one of Misko's underling's descendant's
neighbors. As solid a lead as any."
19,Talk14,"そんな確かな筋の知り合いがいるなんて！
兄さんはさすがだね！","Just knowing someone with good intel
like that? Exactly what I'd expect from
you, Dak!"
20,Talk15,"この謎は神童と呼ばれたドミダク兄さんですら
手こずる難解な謎なんだ
素人が手を出すだけ時間の無駄だろうよ","But this riddle has even I, Domidak,
the premier treasure hunter,
scratching my head.
So that you can tell how challenging my
work is, I'll tell it to you. You'll never
solve it, though."
21,Talk16,"『若き橋架かる川面の源流の
闇夜に浮かぶ天の白滝』","The little twin steps over the little river.
My cave rests above that river's source."
22,Talk17,"100ルピーだ

本当なら1000ルピーはくだらない特ダネだぜ
どうする？兄ちゃん","It'll be 100 rupees to learn what
we know.

Truth is, it'd be a steal to get this
exclusive scoop for 1,000 rupees...
So what do you say?"
23,Talk18,"何だお前俺らの話を
勝手に聞いてんじゃねぇよ","Hey, buddy! What's your problem? You
aren't being incredibly rude and listening
to our conversation, are you?"
24,Talk19,"俺らはトレジャーハンターなんだ！
大盗賊ラムダの財宝は俺らのもんだぜ！","We're treasure hunters, on the trail of
our latest score... The treasure of the
great bandit Misko! It's as good as ours!"
25,Talk20,"さすが最強のトレジャーハンター！
金のニオイは逃さない！ さすがだね兄さん！","That's the keen sense of the strongest
treasure hunter at work! No gold left
behind—not by Domidak!
You're great, Dak!"
26,Talk22,"しかし俺たちが狙ってるのは
あの大盗賊ラムダの財宝だ
もし見つけたら一攫千金…
一夜で大金持ちだ
そんな情報をタダで手に入れようってのは
虫が良すぎるよなぁ","We're after nothing less than the
treasure of Misko, the Great Bandit!
Finding it would mean incredible riches...
I'm not about to give this information
away for free. I'm no fool!"
27,near00,うーむ…,Hrm...
28,near01,きっとあそこだよ！,I bet it's over there!
