1,Atacked00,しーっ…魔物に気づかれるぞ,Shhh... Do you want to get found out?
2,Atacked01,こっちが聞きたい…どうしたらいい？,"I'm no warrior, so I'm leaving it up to
you. What should we do?"
3,Failed00,魔物に立ち向かおうとは俺は思わない…,"I don't have it in me to stand up to
vicious monsters like that..."
4,Failed01,命がいくつあっても足りないな…,"I've only got one life to live, you know.
And losing that isn't exactly high on my
list of priorities."
5,Guardian00,今なら ガーディアンから逃げられそうだ…,"Now would be a good time to get away
from any Guardians around..."
6,MSG_Rane_00,"…北と南 どちらに馬を走らせるべきか？
まあ俺なら無茶はしない
冒険心を刺激する危険な北部地域はやめて
南部にあるリバーサイド馬宿をめざすよ","I'm trying to decide whether to ride
north or south. I guess it's all a matter
of how much adventure I'm looking for...
Things to the north can get pretty
dangerous pretty fast, so I think I'll head
for Riverside Stable in the south instead."
7,MSG_Rane_00_1,"俺なら危険な北部地域はやめて
南部にあるリバーサイド馬宿をめざすよ","I think I'll steer clear of the north for
now. Riverside Stable down south is
more my speed...and less stabby."
8,MSG_Rane_01,"…ちょっとした知識が冒険の助けになる
たとえば カエルやタニシ…
どちらも雨の日に活動的になる生き物で
どちらも薬のよい材料だと覚えておくべきだ","A little knowledge goes a long way when
you're out on your own in the great and
vast wilderness of Hyrule.
Take frogs and snails, for example...
They both come out on days when
it's gonna rain.
And they can both be used to make
elixirs. That's worth remembering
when you're out on the road."
9,MSG_Rane_01_1,"カエルやタニシは雨の日に活動的になり
薬のよい材料だと覚えておくべきだ","Frogs and snails come out when it's
gonna rain. They make good elixirs,
so you'll want to keep that in mind."
10,MSG_Rane_02,"…勇気と蛮勇は ちがう
真の冒険者はむしろ雷を恐れるもの
落雷を防ぐため金属類は避けて
木製品や布製品を いち早く身に着けるものだ","Being brave doesn't have to mean being
reckless. A real adventurer knows to fear
the lightning.
If you don't want to get hit by lightning,
you'll want to avoid gear made of metal.
Swap out for wood or cloth gear, fast!"

12,MSG_Rane_03,"雨の崖は時間の無駄…という
ハイラルの古いコトワザがある
雨の日は どうせ滑って登れないから
崖登りに意地になるより平地を行くべきだ","Don't waste your time trying to climb
cliffs in the rain. That's a bit of old
Hyrule wisdom I'm sharing with you.
Rainy days make the rock slippery and
hard to climb, so it's best to forget about
it for the day and stick to flat land."
13,MSG_Rane_03_1,"雨の日は どうせ滑って登れないから
崖登りに意地になるより平地を行くべきだ","Rainy days make the rock slippery and

14,MSG_Rane_04,"…たまには こんな情報はどうだ？
イーガ団幹部が大好物…それは…
バナナ！","Want a little tidbit of info that might
come in handy someday? OK, here we
go... Hold on to your hat...
You know what the leader of the Yiga
Clan loves the most? You'll never guess.
Bananas!"

16,Near00,イヌは なつく…,I sure like dogs...
17,Near01,チュチュの目を撃て…,Shoot Chuchus in the eye.
18,Near02,草を刈ると妖精が…,"Cut grass, get fairies!"
19,Near03,温泉でゆでタマゴ…,Mmm. Eggs in hot springs.
20,Near04,雨といえば…,Where there's rain...
21,Rest_00,"…知りたいなら いくらでも教えてやろう
俺は情報の出し惜しみは しない主義だ
魚は同じ名前の素材を投げ込むと突きにくる
例えば ガンバリバスならガンバリダケ…","If you ever need any little tips and tricks
for how to get through life, come see me.
I'm not one to be stingy with information.
For example: fish will come nibble at
ingredients with similar properties when
you throw them in the water.
So if you toss, say, stamella shrooms
into the water, staminoka bass will show
up to feed on them."
22,Rest_01,"…雨といえば？
そう…雷の可能性だ
自らへの落雷を防ぐためには
身に着けた金属類を外すといい","You know what they say... Where there's
rain, there's lightning. Shocking, isn't it?

And if you don't want to get struck by
lightning, you'd better remove any
metallic equipment, pronto!"
23,Rest_02,"…雨といえば？
意外かもしれないが…買い物日和だ
そのままでは客足が鈍るので
とておきの品を売りに出すことが多いんだ","You know what they say... Where there's
rain...there's also good shopping.
OK, so maybe nobody says that.
But it's true! With fewer customers
around, merchants often pull out their
special goods to attract more shoppers."
24,RetMSG_Rane_00,"見たところ君は知恵も勇気もある冒険家
…に憧れる向こう見ずな若者に思える
ハイラル城に いつか潜入しようなどという
危険すぎる野望さえ もっていそうだな…","Ah, a young and courageous adventurer
approaches! That IS what you are, is it
not? You have that look about you.
I'd call it a bit of a roguish look, for that
matter. Like you'd consider infiltrating
Hyrule Castle at some point..."
25,RetMSG_Rane_00_1,"君は ハイラル城に いつか潜入しようという

you. Like someone who might consider

26,RetMSG_Rane_01,"…目を見ればわかる
あふれる好奇心を持て余しているな？
ならば危険なハイラル城に潜入して
王家のお宝を探すという無茶は どうだ？","I've seen that look before. That's the
look of someone whose curiosity
overwhelms his caution.
If so, you might consider infiltrating the
dangerous Hyrule Castle to seek out the
lost treasures of the royal family..."
27,RetMSG_Rane_01_1,"危険なハイラル城に潜入して
王家のお宝を探す… やってみてはどうだ？","Why not infiltrate the dangerous
Hyrule Castle to seek out the lost
treasures of the royal family?"
28,RetMSG_Rane_02,"…勇気はありそうだが教養はどうだ？
例えば金属類に落ちやすいという雷の性質…
知っていれば雨の日に金属は身につけないし
逆に魔物には金属の武器を…と考えるはず","You've courage, sure—you'd need it to
go out adventuring—but how about
smarts? Here's a quick test.
Lightning is more common on rainy days,
right? That's not the test... But knowing
this, you'd avoid metal gear in the rain.
But what do you think might happen if
you threw a metal weapon at a monster?
Is that an electrifying concept or what?"
29,RetMSG_Rane_02_1,"金属類に落ちやすいという雷の性質…

知っていれば雨の日に金属は身につけないし
逆に魔物には金属の武器を…と考えるはず","Lightning tends to strike metal objects
more often... Knowing this might make
you not equip metal gear on rainy days...
But it might make you consider throwing
a metal weapon at a monster at the
perfect time... Maybe give it a shot."
30,RetMSG_Rane_03,"…まさか やるべき事を
見失ってはいないよな？
虫捕ったり泳いだり城に潜入したり寝たり…
やるべきことは星の数ほどあるぞ？","I've seen that look in your eyes before.
You've lost sight of what's important in
life, haven't you?
Catching bugs, swimming, infiltrating the
castle, sleeping... The possibilities are
limitless, don't you think?"

32,RetMSG_Rane_04,"客足が鈍る雨の日こそ逆に買い物日和だ
…なぜだかわかるか？
客寄せのために とっておきの品が
並ぶことが多いからさ","Shopkeepers get fewer customers on
rainy days, but that's sometimes the best
time to go shopping. You know why?
Because that's when they bring out their
special goods. You never know what they
keep on hand as an added incentive."

34,SavedLv1_00,心配ないもう魔物は去ったはず,"No need to worry. Those monsters must
be gone by now."
35,SavedLv1_01,魔物の方も…こちらを怖がってるものだ,"Maybe those monsters were just as
scared of us as we were of them..."
36,SavedLv2_00,そうだな…今の撃退方法は正しいな,Sweet... I guess that takes care of that.
37,SavedLv2_01,…ピンチは去ったと考えて よさそうだ,"...I'm gonna assume we're in the clear
now and get back to what I was doing."
38,SavedLv3_00,ここは君に礼を言っておこう…,I should really thank you.
39,SavedLv3_01,さすがだな…礼を言うよ,You're really something. Thanks so much.
40,Thanks00,"これは気持ちだ
受け取ってくれ","Here, I want you to have this. It's just
a small token of my appreciation."
