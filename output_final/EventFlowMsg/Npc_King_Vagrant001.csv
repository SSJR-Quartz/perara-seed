食材は そのまま食うのもいいが
あぶった方が栄養も増して美味いんじゃ","I'm relaxing by the fireside, of course.
Although I'll need to cook myself another

some of the treasure hidden here
on the plateau, correct?"
32,Talk08,"祠探しのほうは どうじゃ？

are you planning to use it?"
46,Torch01,"ぶっそうなヤツめ…
そいつは火をつけるのに使うもんじゃ
この先には魔物もおる
武器なら もっとマシなのにするんじゃな","Innovative... However, that is probably
best used to light fires. If you need a
weapon, you can find something better."
47,Torch02,"わしのオノでもいいのなら その辺にあるぞ
持っていくがいいわい","Many beasts roam the land past this
point. You can take my axe with you,
if you please. Assuming you can find it."
48,Torch02_2,"わしのオノを持っているようじゃが
そっちの方が役に立つんじゃないかのう","Ah, I see you found my axe. I do believe
it will be of more use to you than it is
to me."
49,Torch03,"あぶないヤツめ…
燃えやすい草の近くで振り回すんじゃないぞ
とはいえ この先には魔物もおるでな
いざとなったら武器として使うのもいいがな","That is rather...unnerving. Please be
cautious with that around any dry
grass that might catch fire.
You know, there are plenty of monsters
in this area. That torch would make
a good weapon, if need be."
50,Torch04,"ふん…好きにするがいいわい

言っておくが この先には魔物がおるぞ
いざとなったら武器としてでも使うんじゃな","I see. Well then, do as you please.


There are plenty of monsters ahead of
here, though. Remember that you can
use that as a weapon, if need be."
51,Torch05,"適当に振り回さずに相手を向いて
しっかりと間合いをとることじゃ","However, do not just swing it around
without purpose. You must face your
opponents and lock your sights on them!"
