4,Talk_01,"神獣が暴れてるってのに
華奢なハイリア人が
よくこのゲルドの街に
来られたもんだね
族長様は大丈夫だって
おっしゃってるけど…
あの神獣が ここにやってこないって
保証はないからねぇ…
あたしゃ不安で不安で
夜も眠れなくてねぇ…","Even with the Divine Beast out there
making a fuss, a little vai like you just
strolls into town...
You've done well to make it to
Gerudo Town.

The chief keeps saying that everything
is going to be OK, but thinking about the
Divine Beast makes me so uneasy..."
5,Talk_02,"あの神獣が この街にやってこないって
保証はないからねぇ…
族長様は大丈夫だっておっしゃってるけど…
あたしゃ やっぱり不安でねぇ…","There's no guarantee that Divine Beast
won't come marching right into town.

The chief keeps saying everything is
fine... But I can't help this anxious
feeling."
6,Talk_03,"あんた ゲルド砂漠を渡ってきたんだろ？
じゃあ あの外を歩いてる でっかいの見ただろ？
数週間前に いきなり現れてねぇ…

あんなのが
近くを歩いてるってだけでも怖いのに
近づいたら雷にやられるって言うし
もしこの街に近づいたらって思うとね…","You crossed the Gerudo Desert to get
here, right? So you must have seen the
giant walking around outside...
It appeared suddenly a few weeks ago.
It's a daunting sight.

If you get too close to it, it'll lash out at
you with lightning. I can't imagine what
would happen if it came to town..."
7,Talk_04,"あんたも アレには
近づかないことだね","You should be careful and not get too
close to it."
8,Talk_05,"あんたの事知ってるよ
神獣が暴れてた時に この街に来てただろ？
華奢なハイリア人が よく来られたもんだと
感心してたんだ
でも今は大人しくしてくれてるから
あんたみたいな観光客も来やすくなるし
この街も もっと賑わうだろうさ

でもさ…
また暴れださないって保証はないからねぇ…
あたしゃ まだ不安だけどねぇ…","I know you. You're the one who came to
town when the Divine Beast was still
causing trouble, weren't you?
I remember thinking it was amazing that
a slender little Hylian had made it all the
way here in the midst of that.
But now it's calmed down, so it'll be
easier for tourists like you to come visit,
and the town will be even more lively.
Still... There's no guarantee that the
Divine Beast won't act up again. Just
thinking about it makes me uneasy."
9,Talk_06,"この街にはルージュ様っていう
立派な族長様がいらっしゃるんだ
先代の族長様が
若くして亡くなられてしまって
一人娘だったルージュ様に
王位が継承されたばかりなんだけど…","This town is led by our fantastic chief,
Lady Riju. She became chief after her
mother, our old chief, passed away.
Though young, Lady Riju was our old
chief's only child, so naturally the duties
of leading the Gerudo fell to her."
10,Talk_07,"神獣が暴れるわ
お上もトラブル続きだわで
かなり頭を悩まされているって聞いたよ…","There have been other troubles on top of
the Divine Beast acting violently.

I hear it has the chief and her advisors
pretty worried..."
11,Talk_08,"まっ…嫌なことは
呑んで騒いで寝ちまえば忘れちゃうんだけどね","Well... I'll just try to keep my spirits up.
Maybe visit the canteen then get a good
night's sleep..."
12,Talk_09,サヴォッタ,Sav'otta!
13,Talk_10,サヴァーク！,Sav'aaq!
14,Talk_11,サヴァサーバ,Sav'saaba!
15,Talk_12,"何があったか知らないけどさ
あの神獣が あんなに大人しくなるなんてね～
でもあたしゃまだ信用してないよ
いつまた動きだすかわからないからね
そう考えたら不安で不安で
夜も眠れなくてねぇ…","I don't know what caused it, but
I'm relieved to see that the Divine Beast
could be calmed!
I'm still uneasy, though... You never
know if it might start stomping around
again."
16,Talk_13,"族長様はアレは100年前までは
この辺りの守り神だったとおっしゃってるけど…
にわかには信じられないよねぇ…","The chief says that thing used to be a
god who protected this area around
100 years ago...
But that story sounds too crazy to
believe, don't you think? I need to think
on it..."
